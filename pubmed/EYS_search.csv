Retina,"To describe the natural history, genetic landscape and phenotypic spectrum of EYS- associated retinal degeneration (EYS-RD).
Retrospective, single-center cohort study complemented by a cross-sectional examination.
Patients with biallelic EYS variants recruited at an inherited retinal degeneration referral center in Portugal.
Every patient underwent a cross-sectional examination comprising a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), dilated slit-lamp anterior segment and fundus biomicroscopy; ultra-widefield color fundus photography and fundus autofluorescence imaging; and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). In the setting of a retinitis pigmentosa (RP) diagnosis, every patient was classified as typical or atypical RP according to imaging criteria. Baseline demographics, age at onset of symptoms, family history, history of consanguinity, symptoms, age at diagnosis, BCVA at baseline and throughout follow-up, and EYS variants were collected from each individual patient file.
Clinical/demographic, genetic, multimodal imaging data (ellipsoid zone widths) and BCVA variation were compared between typical and atypical RP. Additionally, BCVA variation during follow-up was used as an endpoint to describe EYS-RD natural history.
Fifty-eight patients (59% males; mean age 52±14 years) from 48 Caucasian families of Portuguese ancestry were included. Twenty distinct EYS variants were identified, eight of which are novel. In 32.8% patients, onset of symptoms was in early adulthood (21-30 years). A clinical diagnosis of RP was established in 57 patients and cone-rod dystrophy in one patient. Regarding RP, 75.0% of the patients were graded as typical and 25.0% as atypical. Atypical EYS-RP commonly presents with inferior crescent-shaped macular atrophy with superior mid-peripheral sparing. In EYS-RD, a negative correlation was found between age and BCVA (r=-0.50; p<0.001), with an average loss of 1.45 letters per year. When stratifying for RP phenotype, lower average loss of letters per year (p<0.001), higher BCVA (p<0.001) and larger ellipsoid zone (EZ) widths (p<0.001) were found in atypical RP.
This study expands the genetic spectrum of EYS-RD by reporting 8 novel variants. A high frequency of atypical phenotypes was identified. These patients have better BCVA and larger EZ widths, thus presenting an overall better prognosis.",,Copyright © 2023.

RCD genes classification is based exclusively on gene mutations' prevalence and does not consider the implication of the same gene in different phenotypes. Therefore, we first investigated the mutations occurrence in autosomal recessive RCD (arRCD) and non-arRCD conditions. Then, finally, we identified arRCD enriched mutational patterns in specific genes and coding exons.
The mutations patterns differed according to arRCD (p=0.001). Specifically, When compared with missense; insertions/deletions (OR=1.2, p=0.007), nonsense (OR=1.2, p=0.014) and splice-site mutations (OR=1.6, p=0.038) increased the OR of arRCD by 20%-60% versus non-arRCD conditions.

Although the identification of SVs significantly improved upon the availability of genome sequencing, it is expected that involvement of SVs in IRDs is higher than anticipated. We revisited short-read genome sequencing data to enhance the identification of gene-disruptive SVs.
Optical genome mapping was performed to improve SV detection in short-read genome sequencing-negative cases. In addition, reanalysis of short-read genome sequencing data was performed to improve the interpretation of SVs and to re-establish SV prioritization criteria.
In a monoallelic USH2A case, optical genome mapping identified a pericentric inversion (173 megabase), with 1 breakpoint disrupting USH2A. Retrospectively, the variant could be observed in genome sequencing data but was previously deemed false positive. Reanalysis of short-read genome sequencing data (427 IRD cases) was performed which yielded 30 pathogenic SVs affecting, among other genes, USH2A (n = 15), PRPF31 (n = 3), and EYS (n = 2). Eight of these (>25%) were overlooked during previous analyses.
Critical evaluation of our findings allowed us to re-establish and improve our SV prioritization and interpretation guidelines, which will prevent missing pathogenic events in future analyses. Our data suggest that more attention should be paid to SV interpretation and the current contribution of SVs in IRDs is still underestimated.","Critical evaluation of our findings allowed us to re-establish and improve our SV prioritization and interpretation guidelines, which will prevent missing pathogenic events in future analyses.

However, current dPCR systems often require DNA templates to share partitions due to limited partitioning capacities. Here, we introduce UltraPCR, a next-generation dPCR system where DNA counting is performed in a single-molecule regimen through a 6-log dynamic range using a swift and parallelized workflow. Each UltraPCR reaction is divided into >30 million partitions without microfluidics to achieve single template occupancy. Combined with a unique emulsion chemistry, partitions are optically clear, enabling the use of a three-dimensional imaging technique to rapidly detect DNA-positive partitions. Single-molecule occupancy also allows for more straightforward multiplex assay development due to the absence of partition-specific competition. As a proof of concept, we developed a 222-plex UltraPCR assay and demonstrated its potential use as a rapid, low-cost screening assay for noninvasive prenatal testing for as low as 4% trisomy fraction samples with high precision, accuracy, and reproducibility.",,,[],,"36508568

We report the genes currently associated with an IRD that possess an SP sequence and assess the prevalence of these variants in a multi-institutional retrospective review of clinical genetic testing records. The online databases, RetNet and UniProt, were used to determine which IRD genes possess a SP. A multicenter retrospective review was performed to retrieve cases of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of an IRD and a concurrent SP variant. In silico evaluations were performed with MutPred, MutationTaster, and the signal peptide prediction tool, SignalP 6.0. SignalP 6.0 was further used to determine the locations of the three SP regions in each gene: the N-terminal region, hydrophobic core, and C-terminal region. Fifty-six (56) genes currently associated with an IRD possess a SP sequence. Based on the records review, a total of 505 variants were present in the 56 SP-possessing genes. Six (1.18%) of these variants were within the SP sequence and likely associated with the patients' disease based on in silico predictions and clinical correlation.

Mutations in more than 300 genes have been associated with syndromic and non-syndromic IRDs. Recessive forms are more frequent in populations where endogamy is a social preference, such as Pakistan. The aim of this study was to identify molecular determinants of IRDs with the common presentation of night blindness in consanguineous Pakistani families. This study included nine consanguineous IRD-affected families that presented autosomal recessive inheritance of the night blindness phenotype. DNA was extracted from blood samples. Targeted exome sequencing of 344 known genes for retinal dystrophies was performed. Screening of nine affected families revealed two novel (c.5571_5576delinsCTAGATand c.471dup in ",,,"['autosomal recessive', 'homozygous sequence variants', 'night blindness', 'retinaldystrophies']",,"36140798

This was a retrospective cross-sectional observational study of 36 patients with EYS-associated autosomal recessive RP (arRP).
The gene sequencing results revealed that c.6416G>A (p.Cys2139Tyr) and c.7228+1G>A were the two most predominant variants in our cohort and that variants near the C-terminus, which contains alternating laminin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, accounted for the majority of the allele counts (58 of a total of 72) and relative allele frequencies (81%). Over half of the patients presented with pericentral-type RP (n = 19, 60%), which frequently occurred in combination with macular lesions (n = 10, 52%). Patients having both variants within the alternating laminin and EGF domains near the C-terminus had a more severe disease progression (average 0.045 logMAR increase per year) than those having one variant in the N-terminus and the other in the C-terminus (average 0.001 logMAR increase per year).
Pericentral RP was the major phenotype in patients with EYS-associated arRP. There was also a statistically significant relationship between the location of the variants and the severity of the disease.

Molecular genetic diagnosis of RP is quite challenging because of the complicated disease-causing mutation spectrum. The aim of this study was to explore the mutation spectrum in Chinese RP patients using next-generation sequencing technology and to explore the genotype-phenotype relationship.
In this study, a cost-effective strategy using whole-exome sequencing (WES) was employed to address the genetic diagnosis of 28 RP families in China. One to two patients and zero to two healthy relatives were sequenced in each family. All mutations in WES data that passed through the filtering procedure were searched in relation to 662 gene defects that can cause vision-associated phenotypes (including 89 RP genes in the RetNet Database). All patients visiting the outpatient department received comprehensive ophthalmic examinations.
Twenty-five putative pathogenic mutations of 12 genes were detected by WES and were all confirmed by Sanger sequencing in 20 (20/28, 71.4%) families, including the 12 following genes:

This study aimed at assessing the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing (ES) for an unselected cohort of individuals with hereditary retinal disorders. It is a retrospective study of 357 unrelated affected individuals, diagnosed with retinal disorders who underwent clinical ES. Variants from ES were filtered, prioritized, and classified using the ACMG recommendations. Clinical diagnosis of the individuals included rod-cone dystrophy (60%), macular dystrophy (20%), cone-rod dystrophy (9%), cone dystrophy (4%) and other phenotypes (7%). Majority of the cases (74%) were singletons and 6% were trios. A confirmed molecular diagnosis was obtained in 24% of cases. In 6% of cases, two pathogenic variants were identified with phase unknown, bringing the potential molecular diagnostic rate to ~ 30%. Including the variants of uncertain significance (VUS), potentially significant findings were reported in 57% of cases. Among cases with a confirmed molecular diagnosis, variants in EYS, ABCA4, USH2A, KIZ, CERKL, DHDDS, PROM1, NR2E3, CNGB1, ABCC6, PRPH2, RHO, PRPF31, PRPF8, SNRNP200, RP1, CHM, RPGR were identified in more than one affected individual.

The manner of decay of genetically defective EYS gene transcripts varies depending on the type of mutation using our cellular model, which consists of induced photoreceptor-directed fibroblasts from EYS-RP patients (EYS-RP cells). However, disease-specific profiles have not been clarified in EYS-RP cells. Herein we investigated comprehensive gene expression patterns and restoration of altered expression by low molecular weight molecules in EYS-RP cells.
Using induced photoreceptor-like cells by CRX, RAX, NeuroD, and OTX2, we employed qRT-PCR and DNA microarray analysis to compare expression levels of disease-related genes in EYS-RP cells. We investigated the effect of antiapoptotic or anti-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/antioxidant reagents on the restoration of altered gene expression.
Expression levels of phototransduction-related genes (blue opsin, rhodopsin, S-antigen, GNAT1, GNAT2) were lower in EYS-RP cells. CRYGD was extracted by global gene expression analysis, as a downregulated, retina-related and apoptosis-, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress- or aging-related gene. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that ""complement and coagulation cascades,"" ""ECM-receptor interaction"" and ""PI3K-Akt signaling pathway"" could be involved in EYS-RP-associated pathogenesis. Among the matching/overlapping genes involved in those pathways, F2R was suggested as an EYS-RP-associated gene. The downregulation of CRYGD and F2R was completely restored by additional 4-PBA, an inhibitor of ER stress, and partially restored by metformin or NAC. In addition, 4-PBA normalized the expression level of cleaved caspase-3.
Our cellular model may reflect the ER stress-mediated degenerative retina and serve as a pathogenesis-oriented cost-effective rescue strategy for RP patients.",,© 2022.

ESCC is also the most common pathological type of oesophageal cancer (EC) in China. Ras-related genes are one of the most frequently mutated gene families in cancer and regulate tumour development and progression. Given this, we investigated the Ras-related gene expression profiles and their values in ESCC prognosis, using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. We found that we could identify three distinct oesophageal cancer clusters based on their unique expression profile for 11 differentially expressed Ras-related genes with each of these demonstrating some prognostic value when, evaluated using univariate Cox analysis. We then used multivariate Cox analysis to identify relevant independent prognostic indicators and used these to build a new prognostic prediction model for oesophageal cancer patients using these three Ras-related genes. These evaluations produced an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.932. We found that our Ras-related signatures could also act as independent factors in ESCC prognosis and that patients with low Ras scores showed a higher overall expression levels of various immune checkpoint genes, including TNFSF4, TNFRSF8, TNFRSF9, NRP1, CD28, CD70, CD200, CD276, METTL16, METTL14, ZC3H13, YTHDF3, VIRMA, FTO, and RBM15, as well as a higher CSMD3, FLG, DNAH5, MUC4, PLCO, EYS, and ZNF804B mutation rates, and better sensitivity to drugs such as erlotinib, paclitaxel, and gefitinib. In conclusion, we were able to use the unique expression profiles of several Ras-related genes to produce a novel disease signature which might facilitate improved prognosis in ESCC, providing new insight into both diagnosis and treatment in these cancers.",,"Copyright © 2022 Yang, Liu, Zheng, Cai, Luo, Feng and Lei.","['GTEx', 'TCGA', 'bioinformatics analysis', 'oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma', 'prognosis', 'ras']",,"35281814

A cohort of 1036 families was classified according to their suspected clinical diagnosis-Stargardt disease (STGD), cone and cone-rod dystrophy (CCRD) or other maculopathies (otherMD). Molecular studies included genotyping microarrays, Sanger sequencing, NGS, and sequencing of intronic regions of the ABCA4 gene. Clinical reclassification was done after the genetic study.
At the end of the study, 677 patients (65%) had a confirmed genetic diagnosis, representing 78%, 63%, and 38% of STGD, CCRD, and otherMD groups of patients, respectively. ABCA4 is the most mutated gene in all groups, and a second pathogenic variant was found in 76% of STGD patients with one previously identified mutated ABCA4 allele. Autosomal dominant or X-linked mutations were found in 5% of cases together with not-MD genes (CHM, EYS, RHO, RPGR, RLBP1, OPA1, and USH2A among others) leading to their reclassification. Novel variants in the very rare genes PLA2G5 and TTLL5 revealed additional phenotypic associations.
This study provides for the first time a genetic landscape of 1036 ar/sMD families according to their suspected diagnosis. The analysis of >200 genes associated with retinal dystrophies and the entire locus of ABCA4 increase the rate of characterization, even regardless of available clinical and familiar data. The use of the suspected a priori diagnosis referred by the clinicians, especially in the past, could lead to clinical reclassifications to other inherited retinal dystrophies.",,,[],,"35119454

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with retinitis pigmentosa. Patients with records of the following were included: (1) ocular biometry measurements using the IOLMaster 700 and (2) genetic diagnostic tests. Axial length, keratometry, anterior chamber depth, aqueous depth, lens thickness, central corneal thickness (CCT), and corneal diameter (white to white) measurements were extracted. Based on keratometry measurements, (1) standard keratometric astigmatism, (2) posterior corneal astigmatism, and (3) total corneal astigmatism were obtained. Demographics and biometric parameters were compared between patients with EYS-related retinitis pigmentosa and other patients with retinitis pigmentosa.
A total of 86 eyes of 44 patients (23 females and 21 males; mean age: 47.7 years) with retinitis pigmentosa were included. Of these, 18 were identified as having EYS variants. CCT was significantly thinner (P < 0.001) and the posterior corneal curvature at the steepest meridian was significantly smaller (P = 0.024) in patients with EYS-related retinitis pigmentosa than in other patients with retinitis pigmentosa. The magnitudes of all corneal astigmatism measurements was higher in patients with EYS-related RP, although these differences were not statistically significant.
Patients with EYS-related retinitis pigmentosa had unique features in ocular biometry, such as thinner central corneal thickness and smaller posterior corneal curvature radius at the steepest meridian compared with other patients with retinitis pigmentosa. The findings suggest that patients with retinitis pigmentosa have different ocular dimension features among the different causative genes.","Patients with EYS-related retinitis pigmentosa had unique features in ocular biometry, such as thinner central corneal thickness and smaller posterior corneal curvature radius at the steepest meridian compared with other patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

We leveraged paired whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing in the largest LGL leukemia cohort to date, which included 105 patients (93 T-cell receptor αβ [TCRαβ] T-LGL and 12 TCRγδ T-LGL). Seventy-six mutations were observed in 3 or more patients in the cohort, and out of those, STAT3, KMT2D, PIK3R1, TTN, EYS, and SULF1 mutations were shared between both subtypes. We identified ARHGAP25, ABCC9, PCDHA11, SULF1, SLC6A15, DDX59, DNMT3A, FAS, KDM6A, KMT2D, PIK3R1, STAT3, STAT5B, TET2, and TNFAIP3 as recurrently mutated putative drivers using an unbiased driver analysis approach leveraging our whole-exome cohort. Hotspot mutations in STAT3, PIK3R1, and FAS were detected, whereas truncating mutations in epigenetic modifying enzymes such as KMT2D and TET2 were observed. Moreover, STAT3 mutations co-occurred with mutations in chromatin and epigenetic modifying genes, especially KMT2D and SETD1B (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). STAT3 was mutated in 50.5% of the patients. Most common Y640F STAT3 mutation was associated with lower absolute neutrophil count values, and N647I mutation was associated with lower hemoglobin values. Somatic activating mutations (Q160P, D170Y, L287F) in the STAT3 coiled-coil domain were characterized. STAT3-mutant patients exhibited increased mutational burden and enrichment of a mutational signature associated with increased spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Finally, gene expression analysis revealed enrichment of interferon-γ signaling and decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling for STAT3-mutant patients.

Databases searched from inception until August 21st, 2020 include: MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL and Pre-CINAHL, GWAS Catalog and GWAS Central. The included studies had to be GWASs that assessed MOUD in an OUD population. All studies were screened in duplicate. The quality of the included studies was scored and assessed using the Q-Genie tool. Quantitative analysis, as planned in the protocol, was not feasible, so the studies were analyzed qualitatively.
Our search identified 7292 studies. Five studies meeting the eligibility criteria were included. However, only three studies reported results that met our significance threshold of p ≤ 1.0 × 10
The limitations of this study include not being able to synthesize the data in a quantitative way and a conservative eligibility and data collection model.

These clinically heterogeneous disorders are caused by pathogenic variants in more than 270 genes. As 30-40% of cases remain genetically unexplained following conventional genetic testing, we aimed to obtain a genetic diagnosis in an IRD cohort in which the genetic cause was not found using whole-exome sequencing or targeted capture sequencing. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify causative variants in 100 unresolved cases. After initial prioritization, we performed an in-depth interrogation of all noncoding and structural variants in genes when one candidate variant was detected. In addition, functional analysis of putative splice-altering variants was performed using in vitro splice assays. We identified the genetic cause of the disease in 24 patients. Causative coding variants were observed in genes such as ATXN7, CEP78, EYS, FAM161A, and HGSNAT. Gene disrupting structural variants were also detected in ATXN7, PRPF31, and RPGRIP1. In 14 monoallelic cases, we prioritized candidate noncanonical splice sites or deep-intronic variants that were predicted to disrupt the splicing process based on in silico analyses. Of these, seven cases were resolved as they carried pathogenic splice defects. WGS is a powerful tool to identify causative variants residing outside coding regions or heterozygous structural variants. This approach was most efficient in cases with a distinct clinical diagnosis. In addition, in vitro splice assays provide important evidence of the pathogenicity of rare variants.",,© 2021.

0,Valued Insight or Act of Insubordination? How Context Shapes Coaches' Perceptions of Challenge-Oriented Followership.,"Marcus Gottlieb, Mark Eys, James Hardy, Alex J Benson",10.1123/jsep.2021-0122,2021-11-11,Journal of sport & exercise psychology,"Effective leadership is a collaborative effort, requiring a degree of complementarity in how people enact roles of leadership and followership. Using a novel online vignette methodology, we experimentally tested how three contextual factors influenced coaches' responses to challenge-oriented acts of followership, as well as investigated two potential mechanisms. Coaches (N = 232) watched videos of an athlete provided unsolicited challenge-oriented feedback to a coach. Videos varied by the (a) athlete's status, (b) presence of third-party observers, and (c) stage of the decision-making process. Following the video, we assessed coaches' evaluations of the athlete. Challenge-oriented followership was perceived more favorably when enacted by an athlete in one-on-one (vs. in a group) and before a decision has been reached (vs. after a decision is reached). Coaches may appreciate proactivity from athletes in positions of followership, but challenge-oriented followership behaviors enacted at the wrong time and place can elicit negative reactions.",,,"['follower', 'leader', 'leadership', 'proactive', 'role perceptions']",,34758456,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011447597720>,,,,,,

This study aimed to analyze the molecular profiles, associated ocular characteristics, and progression of RP in Korean patients.
All the genetic variants in patients with RP, identified using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a panel of 88 RP-related genes between November 2018 and November 2019, were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmological evaluations, and their clinical and family histories were recorded. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) deterioration and photoreceptor disruption progression rates were determined based on the major causative mutational genes using nonlinear mixed models, and the differences among them were investigated using the interaction effect.
Among the 144 probands, 82 variants in 24 causative genes were identified in 77 families (53.5%). Most of the RP cases were associated with autosomal recessive variants (
In conclusion, our genetic analysis using targeted NGS provides information about the prevalence of RP-associated mutations in Korean patients. Delineating clinical characteristics according to genetic variations may help clinicians identify subtype features and predict the clinical course of RP.","In conclusion, our genetic analysis using targeted NGS provides information about the prevalence of RP-associated mutations in Korean patients.

Thus, this study aims to identify genes that may affect the risk of stress in a large-scale Korean cohort. The stress survey used in this study consisted of 40 questions, organized into the following four categories: 10 questions on General Stress (GenST); 10 questions on Mental Stress (MenST); 10 questions on Physical Stress (PhyST); and 10 questions on Activity Stress (ActST). An overall stress score was calculated as the sum of the survey scores from each category, with a high stress score defined as a stress score in which the proportion of insomnia was large. Genome-wide association studies of approximately 320,000 SNPs acquired from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) were conducted to explore the risk of stress in the four categories. As a result, three loci were identified for GenST, no significant loci were observed for MenST, four loci were identified for PhyST, and two loci were identified for ActST. The most significant SNP of GenST (rs9353437) was located in an epidermal growth factor gene (eyes shut homolog, EYS) and expressed in the photoreceptor layer of the retina. The genome-wide association studies' (GWAS) results of PhyST showed a significant SNP (rs4924370) in a spliceosomal factor (Aquarius intron-binding spliceosomal factor, AQR). Notably, the second most significant SNP (rs1991002) was located in an oxidoreductase gene (NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Subunit S4, NDUFS4) and was also marginally associated with GenST, MenST, and ActST (",,,"['Genome-wide association study', 'genes', 'insomnia', 'single nucleotide polymorphism', 'stress']",,34698592,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114475C7540>,,,,,,

To perform a detailed phenotyping and genetic characterization of 55 Chinese patients with EYS-RD, and to identify risk factors for these clinical data.
A total of 55 patients with EYS-RD were recruited. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), patient age, age at symptom onset, disease duration, and genetic information were collected.
Thirty-six novel variants, three hot mutations of EYS (30.3%, c.6416G>A, c.6557G>A, c.7492G>C) and one hot region (49.06%, Laminin G domains) were identified. In all, 36.84% of the mutations occurred at base G site, and majority of mutations (56.56%) were missense. Late-truncating mutations are significantly more prevalent (41.30%). The mean age of onset was 15.65 ± 14.67 years old; it had no significant correlation with genotype. The average BCVA was 0.73 ± 0.93 LogMAR, and 61.8% of eyes had a BCVA better than 0.52 logMAR. BCVA was positively correlated with disease duration time. The mean MD was 23.18 ± 7.34 dB, MD showed a significant correlation with genotype and age. Cataract was present in 56.45% of patients, and 42.59% of patients showed an absence of pigmentation in the retina. Cataract and hyperpigmentation both showed a significant correlation with age.
EYS-RD is associated with a moderate phenotype with onset around adolescence, but great variability. Our study largely enhances the current knowledge of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of EYS-RD, which could pave the way for better management of these patients.",,© 2021.

We describe six unrelated patients presenting with this atypical phenotype in association with biallelic mutations in EYS gene.
Multinational, multicentre cross-sectional case series. Patients with biallelic disease-causing variants in EYS and a clinical diagnosis of sector RP were recruited from specialized centres in Portugal and Brazil. All patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination complemented by deep phenotyping. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all probands and available relatives for genetic analysis. Genetic counselling was provided to all subjects.
Seven disease-causing variants (4 pathogenic; 3 likely pathogenic) were identified in 6 unrelated female patients. Best-corrected visual acuity ranged from 75 to 85 ETDRS letters.

0,In- and Out-of-Hospital Deaths by Acute Myocardial Infarction in Brazilian State Capitals.,"Sterffeson Lamare Lucena de Abreu, Joana D'Arc Matos França de Abreu, Maria Dos Remédios Freitas Carvalho Branco, Alcione Miranda Dos Santos",10.36660/abc.20200043,2021-09-09,Arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the main cause of death in Brazil and the world. Approximately half of these deaths occur outside the hospital.
To analyze the distribution, temporal evolution, and sociodemographic characteristics (SDC) of in- and out-of-hospital deaths by AMI in Brazilian state capitals and their relationship with municipal development indicators (MDI).
This is an ecological study of the number of deaths due to AMI reported annually by the 27 Brazilian state capitals from 2007 to 2016; these were divided into 2 groups: in-hospital (H) and out-of-hospital (OH). We evaluated the temporal evolution of mortality rates in each group and differences in SDC. Negative binomial regression models were used to compare the temporal evolution of the number of deaths in each group with the following variables: residing in the South/Southeast regions (S/SE), municipal human development index (MHDI), Gini coefficient, and expected years of schooling (EYS). We considered p-values<0.05 as statisticallysignificant.
The OH mortality rate increased with time for all state capitals. All studied SDC were different between groups (p<0.001). In the OH group, most deaths were of men and patients aged 80 years or older and not married. S/SE increased the incidence of OH deaths (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=2.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.67-4.85), while higher EYS reduced it (IRR=0.86; 95% CI=0.77-0.97). In the H group, higher MHDI reduced the incidence of deaths (IRR=0.44; 95% CI=0.33-0.58), while higher EYS increased it (IRR=1.09; 95% CI=1.03-1.15).
In- and out-of-hospital deaths due to AMI in Brazilian state capitals were influenced by MDI, presented sociodemographic differences and a progressive increase in out-of-hospital occurrences.
O infarto agudo do miocárdio (IAM) é a principal causa de óbito no Brasil e no mundo. Aproximadamente metade dos óbitos ocorrem fora do ambiente hospitalar.
Analisar a distribuição, a evolução temporal e as características sociodemográficas (CSD) dos óbitos intra e extra-hospitalares por IAM nas capitais brasileiras e a sua relação com indicadores municipais de desenvolvimento (IMD).
Estudo ecológico com contagem anual dos óbitos por IAM nas 27 capitais brasileiras de 2007 a 2016, os quais foram divididos em dois grupos, intra-hospitalar (H) e extra-hospitalar (EH). Avaliou-se a evolução temporal das taxas de mortalidade em cada grupo e as diferenças das CSD. Modelos de regressão binominal negativa compararam temporalmente a contagem de óbitos em cada grupo com as seguintes variáveis: residir nas regiões Sul e Sudeste (S/SE), índice de desenvolvimento humano municipal (IDHM), índice de Gini e expectativa de anos de estudo (EAE). Considerou-se estatisticamente valores significativos de p < 0,05.
A taxa de mortalidade EH para o conjunto das capitais aumentou ao longo do tempo. Todas as CSD pesquisadas foram difententes entre os grupos (p < 0,001). No grupo EH prevaleceram os óbitos em homens, em pacientes ≥ 80 anos e em solteiros. O S/SE elevou a incidência de óbitos extra-hospitalares (IRR = 2,84; IC 95% = 1,67-4,85), enquanto o maior EAE registrou queda (IRR = 0,86; IC 95% = 0,77-0,97). Para o grupo H, o maior IDHM reduziu a incidência de óbitos (IRR = 0,44; IC 95% = 0,33-0,58), enquanto o maior EAE apresentou crescimento (IRR = 1,09; IC 95% = 1,03-1,15).
Os óbitos intra e extra-hospitalares por IAM nas capitais apresentam diferenças sociodemográficas, incidência influenciada por IMD e progressivo aumento da ocorrência extra-hospitalar.

Their extreme heterogeneity made molecular screening in the era before next-generation sequencing (NGS) expensive and time-consuming. Since then, many NGS studies of IRD molecular background have been conducted in Western populations; however, knowledge of the IRD mutational spectrum in Poland is still limited. Until now, there has been almost no comprehensive analysis of this particular population regarding the molecular basis and inheritance of IRDs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to gain knowledge about the type and prevalence of causative variants in the Polish population.

EYS-retinopathy presents a severe clinical phenotype, and patients currently have no therapeutic options. The progress in personalised medicine and gene and cell therapies hold promise for treating this degenerative disease. However, lack of understanding and incomplete comprehension of disease's mechanism and the role of EYS in the healthy retina are critical limitations for the translation of current technical advances into real therapeutic possibilities. This review recapitulates the present knowledge about EYS-retinopathies, their clinical presentations and proposed genotype-phenotype correlations. Molecular details of the gene and the protein, mainly based on animal model data, are analysed. The proposed cellular localisation and roles of this large multi-domain protein are detailed. Future therapeutic approaches for EYS-retinopathies are discussed.",,,"['Advanced therapies', 'Animal models', 'Ciliopathy', 'EYS', 'Retinal dystrophy']",,"34001227

We retrospectively reviewed patients with genetic diagnosis of EYS-associated RP. The outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness under retinal vessels was measured on SD-OCT vertical scans. As a control, we measured adjacent ONL thickness 100 μm superior and inferior from the vessel. Same measurements were performed in healthy subjects. We calculated the ratio of ONL thickness under vessel divided by the average of adjacent ONL thickness and defined as ONL preservation ratio. In patients with RP, the length of ellipsoid zone (EZ) from the fovea was also measured with SD-OCT vertical scans.
Thirty EYS-associated RP patients and 25 healthy subjects were included. In both groups, ONL thickness overshadowed by retinal vessels was not significantly different from that of adjacent area. However, ONL preservation ratio of RP was larger than that of healthy control in both superior and inferior retina (1.03 vs 0.97; p < 0.01, 1.15 vs 0.95; p < 0.01, respectively). In RP, ONL preservation ratio was significantly larger in the inferior retina than superior retina (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in RP patients, the EZ length from the fovea was always shorter in the inferior than superior retina and there was a significant difference (p < 0.01).
Patients with EYS-associated RP exhibited inferior-dominant photoreceptor death and the relative ONL preservation under retinal vessels. These results suggest that longitudinal environment light exposure may be correlated with the photoreceptor death.",,"© 2021.

Clinical and genetic data from 1302 subjects from 729 genetically confirmed families with IRD registered with the Japan Eye Genetics Consortium were reviewed. Three categories of genetic diagnosis were selected, based on the high prevalence of their causative genes: Stargardt disease (
A total of 417 images from 156 Japanese subjects were examined, including 115 genetically confirmed patients caused by the three prevalent causative genes and 41 normal subjects. The mean overall test accuracy for fundus photographs and FAF images was 88.2% and 81.3%, respectively. The mean overall sensitivity/specificity values for fundus photographs and FAF images were 88.3%/97.4% and 81.8%/95.5%, respectively.
A novel application of deep neural networks in the prediction of the causative IRD genes from fundus photographs and FAF, with a high prediction accuracy of over 80%, was highlighted. These achievements will extensively promote the quality of medical care by facilitating early diagnosis, especially by non-specialists, access to care, reducing the cost of referrals, and preventing unnecessary clinical and genetic testing.","A novel application of deep neural networks in the prediction of the causative IRD genes from fundus photographs and FAF, with a high prediction accuracy of over 80%, was highlighted.

The ortholog of Drosophila eyes shut/spacemaker, EYS on chromosome 6q12 is a major genetic cause of recessive RP worldwide, with prevalence of 5 to 30%. In this study, by using targeted NGS, MLPA and Sanger sequencing we uncovered the EYS gene as one of the most common genetic cause of autosomal recessive RP in northern Sweden accounting for at least 16%. The most frequent pathogenic variant was c.8648_8655del that in some patients was identified in cis with c.1155T>A, indicating Finnish ancestry. We also showed that two novel EYS variants, c.2992_2992+6delinsTG and c.3877+1G>A caused exon skipping in human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293T and in retinal pigment epithelium cells, ARPE-19 demonstrating that in vitro minigene assay is a straightforward tool for the analysis of intronic variants. We conclude, that whenever it is possible, functional testing is of great value for classification of intronic EYS variants and the following molecular testing of family members, their genetic counselling, and inclusion of RP patients to future treatment studies.",,,[],,"33833316

A multicentre, international, database observational study recruited 322 eyes initiating therapy in real-world practice over 5 years. The main outcome measure was mean change in EDTRS letter scores of visual acuity (VA). Secondary outcomes included anatomic outcomes, percentage of eyes with VA >6/12 (70 letters), number of injections and visits, time to first inactivity, switching or non-completion.
Generalised mixed effect models demonstrated that mean (95% CI) adjusted 12-month VA changes for ranibizumab and aflibercept were similar (+10.8 (8.2 to 13.4) vs +10.9 (8.3 to 13.5) letters, respectively, p=0.59). The mean adjusted change in central subfield thickness (CST) was greater for aflibercept than ranibizumab (-170 (-153 to -187) µm vs -147 (-130 to -164) µm, respectively, p=0.001). The overall median (Q1, Q3) of 7 (4, 8) injections and 9 (7, 11) visits was similar between treatment groups. First grading of inactivity occurred sooner with aflibercept (p=0.01). Switching was more common from ranibizumab (37 eyes, 23%) than from aflibercept (17 eyes, 11%; p=0.002).
Visual outcomes at 12 months in this direct comparison of ranibizumab and aflibercept for BRVO in real-world practice were generally good and similar for the 2 drugs, despite a greater effect of aflibercept on CST and time to first grading of inactivity.","Visual outcomes at 12 months in this direct comparison of ranibizumab and aflibercept for BRVO in real-world practice were generally good and similar for the 2 drugs, despite a greater effect of aflibercept on CST and time to first grading of inactivity.",© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

The aim of this study was to characterise the genetic profile of IRD patients in Korea using WES.
We performed comprehensive molecular testing in 168 unrelated Korean IRD patients using WES. The potential pathogenicity of candidate variants was assessed using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology variant interpretation guidelines, in silico prediction tools, published literature, and compatibility with known phenotypes or inheritance patterns.
Causative variants were detected in 86/168 (51.2%) IRD patients, including 58/107 (54.2%) with retinitis pigmentosa, 7/15 (46.7%) with cone and cone-rod dystrophy, 2/3 (66.6%) with Usher syndrome, 1/2 (50.0%) with congenital stationary night blindness, 2/2 (100.0%) with Leber congenital amaurosis, 1/1 (100.0%) with Bietti crystalline dystrophy, 1/1 (100.0%) with Joubert syndrome, 9/10 (90.0%) with Stargardt macular dystrophy, 1/10 (10.0%) with vitelliform macular dystrophy, 1/11 (9.1%) with other forms of macular dystrophy, and 3/4 (75.0%) with choroideraemia. USH2A, ABCA4, and EYS were the most common causative genes associated with IRD. For retinitis pigmentosa, variants of USH2A and EYS were the most common causative gene mutations.
This study demonstrated the distribution of causative genetic mutations in Korean IRD patients. The data will serve as a reference for future genetic screening and development of treatment modalities for Korean IRD patients.",,,"['Inherited retinal degeneration', 'Retinitis pigmentosa', 'Whole-exome sequencing']",,"33691693

The regions were divided into the Tohoku region, the Kanto and Chubu regions, and the Kyushu region according to the location of the hospitals where the participants were enrolled. We compared the proportions of the causative genes and the distributions of the pathogenic variants among these 3 regions.
The proportions of genetically solved cases were 29.4% in the Tohoku region (n = 500), 29.6% in the Kanto and Chubu regions (n = 196), and 29.7% in the Kyushu region (n = 508), which did not differ statistically (P = .99). No significant regional differences in the proportions of each causative gene in genetically solved patients were observed after correction by multiple testing. Among the 29 pathogenic variants detected in all 3 regions, only p.(Pro347Leu) in RHO was an autosomal dominant variant; the remaining 28 variants were found in autosomal recessive genes.

In this cohort study, we tried to address the genetic characteristics and epidemiology of IRDs in Taiwan. Totally, 312 families with IRDs were identified and recruited and genetic testing was performed via probe capture-based NGS targeting 212 IRD-related genes. Statistical analysis was based on the proband of each affected family. Disease-causing genotypes were identified in 178 families (57.1%). ABCA4 variants were the most common cause of disease in this cohort (27 families, 15.2%), whereas CYP4V2 variants were the most common cause for the single phenotype-Bietti's crystalline dystrophy (12 families, 3.8%). Some variants such as ABCA4:c.1804C>T, CYP4V2:c.802-8_810delinsGC, and EYS:c6416G>A were population-specific disease-causing hotspots. Probands affected by ABCA4, RPGR, RP1L1, and CEP290 sought medical help earlier while patients affected by EYS and CYP4V2 visited our clinic at an older age. To evaluate the representativeness of our cohort in the genetic epidemiology of IRDs in Taiwan, our demographic data were compared with that of the total IRD population in Taiwan, obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database. This is currently the largest-scale, comprehensive study investigating the genetic characteristics and epidemiology of IRD in Taiwan.

Previous small series suggested poor outcome. We report on 59 patients with t(8;16) within an international, collaborative study. Median age was 52 (range: 16-75) years. AML was de novo in 58%, therapy-related (t-AML) in 37% and secondary after myelodysplastic syndrome (s-AML) in 5%. Cytogenetics revealed a complex karyotype in 43%. Besides MYST3-CREBBP, whole-genome sequencing on a subset of 10 patients revealed recurrent mutations in ASXL1, BRD3, FLT3, MLH1, POLG, TP53, SAMD4B (n = 3, each), EYS, KRTAP9-1 SPTBN5 (n = 4, each), RUNX1 and TET2 (n = 2, each). Complete remission after intensive chemotherapy was achieved in 84%. Median follow-up was 5·48 years; five-year survival rate was 17%. Patients with s-/t-AML (P = 0·01) and those with complex karyotype (P = 0·04) had an inferior prognosis. Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) was performed in 21 (36%) patients, including 15 in first complete remission (CR1). Allo-HCT in CR1 significantly improved survival (P = 0·04); multivariable analysis revealed that allo-HCT in CR1 was effective in de novo AML but not in patients with s-AML/t-AML and less in patients exhibiting a complex karyotype.

Gene editing with base editors may allow the targeted repair of single-nucleotide transition variants in DNA and RNA. It is unknown how many patients have pathogenic variants that are correctable with a base editing strategy.
To assess the prevalence and spectrum of pathogenic single-nucleotide variants amenable to base editing in common large recessively inherited genes that are associated with inherited retinal degeneration.
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, nonidentifiable records of patients with biallelic pathogenic variants of genes associated with inherited retinal degeneration between July 2013 and December 2019 were analyzed using data from the Oxford University Hospitals Medical Genetics Laboratories, the Leiden Open Variation Database, and previously published studies. Six candidate genes (ABCA4, CDH23, CEP290, EYS, MYO7A, and USH2A), which were determined to be the most common recessive genes with coding sequences not deliverable in a single adeno-associated viral vector, were examined. Data were analyzed from April 16 to May 11, 2020.
Proportion of alleles with a pathogenic transition variant that is potentially correctable with a base editing strategy and proportion of patients with a base-editable allele.
A total of 12 369 alleles from the Leiden Open Variation Database and 179 patients who received diagnoses through the genetic service of the Oxford University Hospitals Medical Genetics Laboratories were analyzed. Editable variants accounted for 53% of all pathogenic variants in the candidate genes contained in the Leiden Open Variation Database. The proportion of pathogenic alleles that were editable varied by gene; 63.1% of alleles in ABCA4, 62.7% of alleles in CDH23, 53.8% of alleles in MYO7A, 41.6% of alleles in CEP290, 37.3% of alleles in USH2A, and 22.2% of alleles in EYS were editable. The 5 most common editable pathogenic variants of each gene accounted for a mean (SD) of 19.1% (9.5%) of all pathogenic alleles within each gene. In the Oxford cohort, 136 of 179 patients (76.0%) had at least 1 editable allele. A total of 53 of 107 patients (49.5%) with biallelic pathogenic variants in the gene ABCA4 and 16 of 56 patients (28.6%) with biallelic pathogenic variants in the gene USH2A had 1 of the 5 most common editable alleles.
This study found that pathogenic variants amenable to base editing commonly occur in inherited retinal degeneration. These findings, if generalized to other cohorts, provide an approach for developing base editing therapies to treat retinal degeneration not amenable to gene therapy.",,,[],,"33507217

Here, we screen human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein via antibody library constructed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a convalescent patient. The CT-P59 mAb potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 isolates including the D614G variant without antibody-dependent enhancement effect. Complex crystal structure of CT-P59 Fab/RBD shows that CT-P59 blocks interaction regions of RBD for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with an orientation that is notably different from previously reported RBD-targeting mAbs. Furthermore, therapeutic effects of CT-P59 are evaluated in three animal models (ferret, hamster, and rhesus monkey), demonstrating a substantial reduction in viral titer along with alleviation of clinical symptoms. Therefore, CT-P59 may be a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.",,,[],,"33436577

While it is sometimes challenging to determine the pathogenicity of identified variants in NGS, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics established the guidelines to help the interpretation. However, as to the genetic screenings for patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in Japan, none of the previous studies utilized the guidelines. Considering that EYS is the major causative gene of RP in Japan, we conducted stepwise genetic screening of 220 Japanese patients with RP utilizing the guidelines. Step 1-4 comprised the following, in order: Sanger sequencing for two major EYS founder mutations; targeted sequencing of all coding regions of EYS; whole genome sequencing; Sanger sequencing for Alu element insertion in RP1, a recently determined founder mutation for RP. Among the detected variants, 2, 19, 173, and 1 variant(s) were considered pathogenic and 8, 41, 44, and 5 patients were genetically solved in step 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Totally, 44.5% (98/220) of the patients were genetically solved, and 50 (51.0%) were EYS-associated and 5 (5.1%) were Alu element-associated. Among the unsolved 122 patients, 22 had at least one possible pathogenic variant.",,,[],,"33247286

Inflammatory chemokines are constitutively produced in such a niche; their binding to receptors on the stem cell helps direct that cell's ""pathotropism."" Neural stem cells (NSCs), which express CXCR4, migrate to sites of CNS injury or degeneration in part because astrocytes and vasculature produce the inflammatory chemokine CXCL12. Binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 (a G protein-coupled receptor, GPCR) triggers repair processes within the NSC. Although a tool directing NSCs to where needed has been long-sought, one would not inject this chemokine in vivo because undesirable inflammation also follows CXCL12-CXCR4 coupling. Alternatively, we chemically ""mutated"" CXCL12, creating a CXCR4 agonist that contained a strong pure binding motif linked to a signaling motif devoid of sequences responsible for synthetic functions. This synthetic dual-moity CXCR4 agonist not only elicited more extensive and persistent human NSC migration and distribution than did native CXCL 12, but induced no host inflammation (or other adverse effects); rather, there was predominantly reparative gene expression. When co-administered with transplanted human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hNSCs in a mouse model of a prototypical neurodegenerative disease, the agonist enhanced migration, dissemination, and integration of donor-derived cells into the diseased cerebral cortex (including as electrophysiologically-active cortical neurons) where their secreted cross-corrective enzyme mediated a therapeutic impact unachieved by cells alone. Such a ""designer"" cytokine receptor-agonist peptide illustrates that treatments can be controlled and optimized by exploiting fundamental stem cell properties (e.g., ""inflammo-attraction"").",,Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

Of the 816 articles retrieved from PubMed, 31 studies conducted on 407 participants from 11 countries were reviewed. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was the most commonly used technique (68%). Autosomal recessive pattern was the most common pattern of inheritance (97%) and half of the known genes associated with RCD (32/63) were identified. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in addition to RP1 (20%) and TULP1 (20%), gene defects in EYS (8%) and CRB1 (7%) were also prevalently mutated. In North Africa, the main gene defects were in MERTK (18%) and RLBP1 (18%). Considering all countries, RP1 and TULP1 remained the most prevalently mutated. Variants in TULP1, RP1, EYS, MERTK, and RLBP1 were the most prevalent, possibly because of founder effects. On the other hand, only ten Individuals were found to have dominant or X-linked RCD. This is the first time a catalog of RCD genetic variations has been established in subjects from the Arabi countries. Although the last decade has seen significant interest, expertise, and an increase in RCD scientific publication, much work needs to be conducted.",,,[],,"33188265

This is an ecological study. The data on cancer incidence and cancer mortality was extracted from the World Bank for Cancer in 2018 (GLOBOCAN 2018). The incidence, mortality rate, and brain cancer distribution maps were drawn for different countries. We used correlation and regression tests to examine the association of incidence and mortality rates of brain cancer with HDI. The statistical analysis was carried out by Stata-14 and a significance level of 0.05 was considered.
According to the results of Global Cancer Registry in 2018, there were 18,078,957 registered cases of cancer in both sexes, of which 29,681 were related to brain cancer. The highest incidence (102,260 cases, 34.4%) and mortality (77,815 cases, 32.3%) belonged to very high HDI regions. Results showed that incidence (r = 0.690, P < 0.0001) and mortality rates (r = 0.629, P < 0.001) of brain cancer are significantly correlated with HDI. We also observed a positive correlation between brain cancer incidence and Gross National Income (GNI) (r = 0.346, P < 0.001), Mean Years of Schooling (MYS) (r = 0.64, P < 0.001), TABLE (LEB) (r = 0.66, P < 0.001) and Expected Years of Schooling (EYS) (r = 0.667, P < 0.001). Results also revealed that mortality rate was significantly correlated with GNI (r = 0.28, P < 0.01), MYS (r = 0.591, P < 0.01), LEB (r = 0.624, P < 0.01), and EYS (r = 0.605, P < 0.01).
The results of the study showed that the incidence and mortality of brain cancer in countries with higher HDI levels is higher than countries with lower HDI levels, so attention to risk factors and action to reduce it in countries with higher HDI levels in controlling this cancer in this Countries are effective.","The results of the study showed that the incidence and mortality of brain cancer in countries with higher HDI levels is higher than countries with lower HDI levels, so attention to risk factors and action to reduce it in countries with higher HDI levels in controlling this cancer in this Countries are effective.",,"['Brain Cancer', 'Human development index', 'Incidence', 'Mortality', 'World']",,"33183267

Here, we evaluate repair outcomes of a Cas9-induced double-strand break (DSB) introduced on the paternal chromosome at the EYS locus, which carries a frameshift mutation causing blindness. We show that the most common repair outcome is microhomology-mediated end joining, which occurs during the first cell cycle in the zygote, leading to embryos with non-mosaic restoration of the reading frame. Notably, about half of the breaks remain unrepaired, resulting in an undetectable paternal allele and, after mitosis, loss of one or both chromosomal arms. Correspondingly, Cas9 off-target cleavage results in chromosomal losses and hemizygous indels because of cleavage of both alleles. These results demonstrate the ability to manipulate chromosome content and reveal significant challenges for mutation correction in human embryos.",,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Retrospective case series.
Review of clinical notes, retinal imaging including color fundus photography (CFP), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), electrophysiological assessment (ERG), and molecular genetic testing were performed in patients with sector RP from a single tertiary referral center. Main outcomes measured were demographic data, signs and symptoms, visual acuity, molecular genetics; and ERG, FAF, and OCT findings.
Twenty-six molecularly confirmed patients from 23 different families were identified harboring likely disease-causing variants in 9 genes. The modes of inheritance were autosomal recessive (AR, n=6: USH1C, n=2; MYO7A, n=2; CDH3, n=1; EYS, n=1), X-linked (XL, n=4: PRPS1, n=1; RPGR, n=3), and autosomal dominant (AD, n=16: IMPDH1, n=3; RP1, n=3; RHO, n=10), with a mean age of disease onset of 38.5, 30.5, and 39.0 years old, respectively. Five of these genes have not previously been reported to cause sector RP (PRPS1, MYO7A, EYS, IMPDH1, and RP1). Inferior and nasal predilection was common across the different genotypes, and patients tended to maintain good central vision. Progression on serial FAF was observed in RPGR, MYO7A, CDH23, EYS, IMPDH1, RP1, and RHO-associated sector RP.

We examined the medical records of the right eyes of 65 cases with RP (31 men and 34 women; average age, 47.6 years). There were 31 cases with the EYS variants, 11 cases with the USH2A variants, six cases with the RPGR variants, 13 cases with the RP1 variants, and four cases with the RP1L1 variants. The mean curvature of Bruch's membrane was calculated within 6 mm of the fovea as the mean macular curvature index (MMCI, 1/µm). We used multiple linear regression analysis to determine the independence of the causative genes contributing to the MMCIs after adjustments for age, sex, axial length, and width of the ellipsoid zone.
The median MMCI was -31.2 × 10-5/µm for the RPGR eyes, -16.5 × 10-5/µm for the RP1L1 eyes, -13.0 × 10-5/µm for the RP1 eyes, -9.8 × 10-5/µm for the EYS eyes, and -9.0 × 10-5/µm for the USH2A eyes. Compared with the EYS gene as the reference gene, the RPGR gene was significantly related to the MMCI values after adjusting for the other parameters (P = 5.30 × 10-6). In contrast, the effects of the other genes, USH2A, RP1, and RP1L1, were not significantly different from that of the EYS gene (P = 0.26, P = 0.49, and P = 0.92, respectively).

This retrospective case series at a tertiary referral centre for inherited retinal diseases describes patients with an IRD and at least two variants in the EYS gene. Phenotyping included multimodal retinal imaging; genotyping molecular genetic analysis using targeted next generation sequencing. Sanger sequencing verification and analysis of novel variants using in silico approaches to determine their predicted pathogenicity.
Eight male and four female patients were included. Age at onset ranged from 11 to 62 years with variable symptom presentation; ten patients showed classical features of retinitis pigmentosa, albeit with great variation in disease severity and extent. Two patients had atypical phenotypes: one with localised inferior sector pigmentation and a mild RP phenotype with changes predominantly at the posterior pole. Eighteen variants in EYS were identified, located across the gene: six were novel. Eight variants were missense, two altered splicing, one was a whole exon duplication and the remainder were predicted to result in premature truncation of the protein.
The marked variability in severity and age of onset in most patients in this ethnically diverse cohort adds to growing evidence that that mild phenotypes are associated with EYS variants. Similarly, the two atypical cases add to the growing diversity of EYS disease as do the six novel pathogenic variants described.","The marked variability in severity and age of onset in most patients in this ethnically diverse cohort adds to growing evidence that that mild phenotypes are associated with EYS variants.

Five diets were formulated to contain 0 (C-), 5 (T5), 10 (T10) or 20 (T20) added taurine (g/kg), while a control diet (C+) included two-fold higher amount of fishmeal (30%) with no taurine supplementation. Seabass fed the T20 or C+ diet showed similar growth, which was significantly higher compared to those in the C-treatment. Histological examination of the muscle, liver and intestine were similar among treatments. No effect on spoilage bacterial growth or production of total volatile basic nitrogen was observed. Taurine supplementation significantly reduced fillet drip loss, while the fillets of European seabass fed the T10 and T20 diets showed significant higher and lower hardness and adhesiveness values, respectively. Moreover, fillet chewiness was also found to be significantly higher in fish fed the T20 diet compared to C+ and C- diets. Overall, it seems that high dietary taurine supplementation acted as a growth promoter and concurrently improved significantly the postharvest quality characteristics of seabass, which may be attributed to its role in maintaining cell membrane integrity and permeability.",,,[],,"32703970

This study aims to evaluate the epidemiology of pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality and its relationship with HDI.
This is a descriptive cross-sectional study that is based on cancer incidence data and cancer mortality rates derived from the GLOBOCAN in 2018. The incidence and mortality rates of Pancreas as well as Pancreas cancer distribution maps were derived for world countries. The data analysis was conducted using a correlation test, and regression tests were used to evaluate the correlation of the incidence and mortality of Pancreas with HDI. The statistical analysis was carried out by Stata-14, and a significance level of 0.05 was considered.
The highest incidence of pancreatic cancer was reported in Asia with 214499 (46.7%) cases and the lowest incidence was related to Oceania with 4529 cases (0.99%). The results showed a positive and significant correlation between incidence (r = 0.764, P <0.0001) and mortality (r = 0.771, P <0.0001) of pancreatic cancer and the HDI index. The results of ANOVA revealed that the highest mean incidence was related to the very high HDI (P <0.0001) and the highest mortality was connected to the very high human development (P <0.0001). The results exhibited that incidence was positively and significantly correlated with GNI (r = 0.497, P <0.0001), MYS (r = 0.746, P <0.0001), LEB (r = 0.676, <0.0001) and EYS (r = 0.738, P <0.0001). Also, a significant positive correlation was found between mortality and GNI (r = 0.507, P <0.0001), MYS (r = 0.745, P <0.0001), LEB (r = 0.679, <0.0001), and EYS (r = 0.748, P <0.0001).
Given the higher incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer in countries with HDI, it is necessary to pay a greater attention to risk factors and appropriate planning to reduce these factors and minimize the impact and mortality rate of this disease.","Given the higher incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer in countries with HDI, it is necessary to pay a greater attention to risk factors and appropriate planning to reduce these factors and minimize the impact and mortality rate of this disease.","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","['Incidence', 'epidemiology', 'human development index', 'mortality', 'pancreatic cancer', 'world']",,32660397,"The highest incidence of pancreatic cancer was reported in Asia with 214499 (46.7%) cases and the lowest incidence was related to Oceania with 4529 cases (0.99%).

Previous research revealed that descriptive norms (i.e., perceptions of others' PA) positively relate to PA intentions/behaviours. This study tested whether self-efficacy mediated the influence of descriptive norms on PA intentions and behaviours, and whether the relationship between descriptive norms and self-efficacy was moderated by perceived similarity with normative referents.
Online questionnaires were administered.
Descriptive norms positively predicted PA behaviour frequency at time 2 indirectly via self-efficacy and PA intentions. These indirect effects were attenuated when baseline PA behaviour frequency was accounted for. There was no support for perceived similarity as a moderator, which may be attributed to a potential ceiling effect or the nature of items used to assess this perception.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive, precluding mechanism-based therapies.
Phenotypic switching denotes a loss of contractile proteins and an increase in migration and proliferation, whereby VSMCs are termed synthetic. We examined how VSMC phenotypic switching influences vascular calcification and the possible role of the uniquely calcium-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS)-forming Nox5 (NADPH oxidase 5).
In vitro cultures of synthetic VSMCs showed decreased expression of contractile markers CNN-1 (calponin 1), α-SMA (α-smooth muscle actin), and SM22-α (smooth muscle protein 22α) and an increase in synthetic marker S100A4 (S100 calcium binding protein A4) compared with contractile VSMCs. This was associated with increased calcification of synthetic cells in response to high extracellular Ca

Retrospective study of electronic patient records.
Patients and relatives managed in the Genetics Service of Moorfields Eye Hospital in whom a molecular diagnosis had been identified.
Genetic screening used a combination of single-gene testing, gene panel testing, whole exome sequencing, and more recently, whole genome sequencing. For this study, genes listed in the Retinal Information Network online resource (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/) were included. Transcript length was extracted for each gene (Ensembl, release 94).
We calculated proportions of families with IRD attributable to variants in each gene in the entire cohort, a cohort younger than 18 years, and a current cohort (at least 1 patient encounter between January 1, 2017, and August 2, 2019). Additionally, we explored correlation between numbers of families and gene transcript length.
We identified 3195 families with a molecular diagnosis (variants in 135 genes), including 4236 affected individuals. The pediatric cohort comprised 452 individuals from 411 families (66 genes). The current cohort comprised 2614 families (131 genes; 3130 affected individuals). The 20 most frequently implicated genes overall (with prevalence rates per families) were as follows: ABCA4 (20.8%), USH2A (9.1%), RPGR (5.1%), PRPH2 (4.6%), BEST1 (3.9%), RS1 (3.5%), RP1 (3.3%), RHO (3.3%), CHM (2.7%), CRB1 (2.1%), PRPF31 (1.8%), MY07A (1.7%), OPA1 (1.6%), CNGB3 (1.4%), RPE65 (1.2%), EYS (1.2%), GUCY2D (1.2%), PROM1 (1.2%), CNGA3 (1.1%), and RDH12 (1.1%). These accounted for 71.8% of all molecularly diagnosed families. Spearman coefficients for correlation between numbers of families and transcript length were 0.20 (P = 0.025) overall and 0.27 (P = 0.017), -0.17 (P = 0.46), and 0.71 (P = 0.047) for genes in which variants exclusively cause recessive, dominant, or X-linked disease, respectively.
Our findings help to quantify the burden of IRD attributable to each gene. More than 70% of families showed pathogenic variants in 1 of 20 genes. Transcript length (relevant to gene delivery strategies) correlated significantly with numbers of affected families (but not for dominant disease).",,Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

We address this challenge preclinically with a prototypical scenario: human neural stem cells (hNSCs) against perinatal/neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII). We demonstrate that a clinically translatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) algorithm, hierarchical region splitting, provides a rigorous, expeditious, prospective, noninvasive ""biomarker"" for identifying subjects with lesions bearing a molecular profile indicative of responsiveness to hNSCs' neuroprotective MOA. Implanted hNSCs improve lesional, motor, and/or cognitive outcomes only when there is an MRI-measurable penumbra that can be forestalled from evolving into necrotic core; the core never improves. Unlike the core, a penumbra is characterized by a molecular profile associated with salvageability. Hence, only lesions characterized by penumbral > core volumes should be treated with cells, making such measurements arguably a regenerative medicine selection biomarker.",,Copyright © 2020.

How EYS and POMGnT1 regulate photoreceptor survival is poorly understood. Since some LG domain-containing proteins function by binding to the matriglycan moiety of O-mannosyl glycans, we hypothesized that EYS interacted with matriglycans as well. To test this hypothesis, we performed EYS Far-Western blotting assay and generated pomgnt1 mutant zebrafish. The results showed that EYS bound to matriglycans. Pomgnt1 mutation in zebrafish resulted in a loss of matriglycan, retention of synaptotagmin-1-positive EYS secretory vesicles within the outer nuclear layer, and diminished EYS protein near the connecting cilia. Photoreceptor density in 2-month old pomgnt1 mutant retina was similar to the wild-type animals but was significantly reduced at 6-months. These results indicate that EYS protein localization to the connecting cilia requires interaction with the matriglycan and that O-mannosyl glycosylation is required for photoreceptor survival in zebrafish. This study identified a novel interaction between EYS and matriglycan demonstrating that RP25 and RP76 are mechanistically linked in that O-mannosyl glycosylation controls targeting of EYS protein.",,,[],,"32385361

The purpose of this study was to identify pathogenic EYS variants, to determine the clinical/genetic spectrum of EYS-associated retinal disease (EYS-RD), and to discover disease-associated variants with relatively high allele frequency (1%-10%) in a nationwide Japanese cohort. Sixty-six affected subjects from 61 families with biallelic or multiple pathogenic/disease-associated EYS variants were ascertained by whole-exome sequencing. Three phenotype groups were identified in EYS-RD: retinitis pigmentosa (RP; 85.94%), cone-rod dystrophy (CORD; 10.94%), and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA; 3.12%). Twenty-six pathogenic/disease-associated EYS variants were identified, including seven novel variants. The two most prevalent variants, p.(Gly843Glu) and p.(Thr2465Ser) were found in 26 and twelve families (42.6%, 19.7%), respectively, for which the allele frequency (AF) in the Japanese population was 2.2% and 3.0%, respectively. These results expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of EYS-RD, accounting for a high proportion of EYS-RD both in autosomal recessive RP (23.4%) and autosomal recessive CORD (9.9%) in the Japanese population. The presence of EYS variants with relatively high AF highlights the importance of considering the pathogenicity of non-rare variants in relatively prevalent Mendelian disorders.",,,[],,"32218477

This can partially be attributed to elusive pathogenic variants (PVs) in known IRD genes, including copy-number variations (CNVs), which have been shown as major contributors to unsolved IRD cases.
Five hundred IRD patients were analyzed with targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). The NGS data were used to detect CNVs with ExomeDepth and gCNV and the results were compared with CNV detection with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Likely causal CNV predictions were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
Likely disease-causing single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels were found in 55.6% of subjects. PVs in USH2A (11.6%), RPGR (4%), and EYS (4%) were the most common. Likely causal CNVs were found in an additional 8.8% of patients. Of the three CNV detection methods, gCNV showed the highest accuracy. Approximately 30% of unsolved subjects had a single likely PV in a recessive IRD gene.
CNV detection using NGS-based algorithms is a reliable method that greatly increases the genetic diagnostic rate of IRDs. Experimentally validating CNVs helps estimate the rate at which IRDs might be solved by a CNV plus a more elusive variant.",CNV detection using NGS-based algorithms is a reliable method that greatly increases the genetic diagnostic rate of IRDs.

Forty-five patients with IRD from 33 families with biallelic RPE65 mutations, 28 stemming from a genetic isolate. We collected retrospective data from medical charts. Coexisting variants in 108 IRD-associated genes were identified with Molecular Inversion Probe analysis.
Most patients were diagnosed within the first years of life. Daytime visual function ranged from near-normal to blindness in the first four decades and met WHO criteria for blindness for visual acuity and visual field in the fifth decade. p.(Thr368His) was the most common variant (54%).

Employing it as a first-tier genetic testing can be favored due to the associated lower incremental cost per diagnosis compared to when using it later in the diagnostic pathway. However, there are technical limitations of WES that can lead to inaccurate negative variant callings. Our study presents these limitations through a re-evaluation of negative WES results using subsequent tests primarily driven by fundoscopic findings. These tests included targeted gene testing, inherited retinal gene panels, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and array comparative genomic hybridization.
Subsequent genetic testing guided by fundoscopy findings identified the following variant types causing retinitis pigmentosa that were not detected by WES: frameshift deletion and nonsense variants in the RPGR gene, 353-bp Alu repeat insertions in the MAK gene, and large exonic deletion variants in the EYS and PRPF31 genes. Deep intronic variants in the ABCA4 gene causing Stargardt disease and the GUCY2D gene causing Leber congenital amaurosis were also identified.
Negative WES analyses inconsistent with the phenotype should raise clinical suspicion. Subsequent genetic testing may detect genetic variants missed by WES and can make patients eligible for gene replacement therapy and upcoming clinical trials. When phenotypic findings support a genetic etiology, negative WES results should be followed by targeted gene sequencing, array based approach or whole genome sequencing.",,,"['Fundoscopy', 'Gene therapy', 'Inherited retinal diseases', 'Whole exome sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing']",,"32000842

In total, 76 families with syndromic or nonsyndromic RP, diagnosed on the basis of clinical manifestations, were recruited for this study. Genomic DNA samples from probands were analyzed by targeted panels or whole exome sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis, Sanger sequencing, and available family member segregation were used to validate sequencing data and confirm the identities of disease-causing genes.
The participants enrolled in the study included 62 families that exhibited nonsyndromic RP, 13 that exhibited Usher syndrome, and one that exhibited Bardet-Biedl syndrome. We found that 43 families (56.6%) had disease-causing variants in 15 genes, including RHO, PRPF31, USH2A, CLRN1, BBS2, CYP4V2, EYS, RPE65, CNGA1, CNGB1, PDE6B, MERTK, RP1, RP2, and RPGR; moreover, 12 families (15.8%) had only one heterozygous variant in seven autosomal recessive RP genes, including USH2A, EYS, CLRN1, CERKL, RP1, CRB1, and SLC7A14. We did not detect any variants in the remaining 21 families (27.6%). We also identified 67 potential pathogenic gene variants, of which 24 were novel.

Several genes are responsible for the disease, but not all cases are explained by mutations in any of these, supporting the fact that there remain other unknown genes that have a role in the syndrome. We aimed to find the genetic cause of presumed USH patients lacking pathogenic mutations in the known USH genes.
Whole exome sequencing was performed on a priori USH-diagnosed subjects from nine unrelated families, which had shown negative results for an USH-targeted panel in a previous study.
We identified possible pathogenic variants in six of the studied families. One patient harbored mutations in REEP6 and TECTA, each gene tentatively causative of one of the two main symptoms of the disease, mimicking the syndrome. In three patients, only the retinal degeneration causative mutations were detected (involving EYS, WDR19, and CNGB1 genes). Another family manifested a dementia-linked retinal dystrophy dependent on an allele dosage in the GRN gene. Last, another case presented a homozygous mutation in ASIC5, a gene not yet associated with USH.

Here, we applied 750K oligonucleotide microarray analysis and whole-exome sequencing (WES) to five trios from Taiwanese families with ASD.
The chromosomal microarray analysis revealed three representative known diagnostic copy number variants that contributed to the clinical presentation: the chromosome locations 2q13, 1q21.1q21.2, and 9q33.1. WES detected 22 rare variants in all trios, including four that were newly discovered, one of which is a de novo variant. Sequencing variants of JMJD1C, TCF12, BIRC6, and NHS have not been previously reported. A novel de novo variant was identified in NHS (p.I7T). Additionally, seven pathogenic variants, including SMPD1, FUT2, BCHE, MYBPC3, DUOX2, EYS, and FLG, were detected in four probands. One of the involved genes, SMPD1, had previously been reported to be mutated in patients with Parkinson's disease.
These findings suggest that de novo or inherited rare variants and copy number variants may be double or multiple hits of the probands that lead to ASD.

To date, we recruited 2,420 families including 3,413 individuals with IRDs. On the basis of our estimation, these patients represent approximately 40% of Israeli IRD patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is, by far, the largest reported IRD cohort, and one of the first studies addressing the genetic analysis of IRD patients on a nationwide scale. The most common inheritance pattern in our cohort is autosomal recessive (60% of families). The most common retinal phenotype is retinitis pigmentosa (43%), followed by Stargardt disease and cone/cone-rod dystrophy. We identified the cause of disease in 56% of the families. Overall, 605 distinct mutations were identified, of which 12% represent prevalent founder mutations. The most frequently mutated genes were ABCA4, USH2A, FAM161A, CNGA3, and EYS.

Once lumbar disc herniation occurs, it seriously reduces patient's quality of life. The EYS (eyes shut homolog) was discovered in recent years and it may be related to lumbar disc herniation. So we conducted a case-control study to explore the relationship between EYS polymorphism and lumbar disc herniation risk.
We selected 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of EYS gene in a case-control study with 508 cases and 508 healthy controls to evaluate the relatedness by using genetic model, haplotype, and stratification analysis.
We found that the minor alleles of rs62413038 (OR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.01-1.43, p = .036) and rs9450607 (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05-1.53, p = .016) were associated with an increased risk of lumbar disc herniation in the allelic model analysis. In the genotypic model analysis, rs62413038 displayed a significantly increased risk of lumbar disc herniation in log-additive models (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01-1.43, p = .039). While the rs9450607 was also obviously associated with an increased lumbar disc herniation risk in recessive (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.24-3.13, p = .004) and log-additive models (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.05-1.55, p = .014). In addition, in the haplotype analyses of the SNPs, we found that the ""CGGA"" haplotype of rs1482456, rs9342097, rs9450607, and rs7757884 was associated with lumbar disc herniation. (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.89, p = .017).

To identify modifiable environmental targets for prevention of high-intensity drinking, we identified characteristics of parties attended by youth and young adults that were associated with high-intensity drinking and the consequences of this excessive form of drinking.
Data are from 15- to 20-year-old participants in an online survey (n = 2,442; 55.4% female, 74.8% White) who resided in 24 communities across 7 states that were a part of a community randomized intervention trial to reduce the incidence and consequences of underage drinking parties. We used multinomial logistic regression to predict level of drinking by 6 party characteristics (size, location, age and gender composition, supervision, others' drinking behavior), and to predict 6 consequences (hangover, not remember event, passed out, punished by parents, broke something/got in fight, and sex against will) from level of drinking. We tested study hypotheses in 2 models, one that used a single binge drinking threshold (below binge vs. at or above binge level) and one that additionally used a high-intensity drinking level (below binge, 1 to 2 times binge, 2+ times binge level).
We found that larger party size and a mostly male composition were unique predictors of high-intensity drinking when compared to those who consumed 1 to 2 times the binge drinking level. Odds of passing out, not remembering the drinking event, breaking/damaging property, or getting in a fight were more than double for high-intensity drinkers compared to standard binge level drinkers.
Results from this study indicate there are unique precursors and consequences of high-intensity alcohol consumption among youth and young adults. These environmental factors associated with high-risk drinking contexts can be used to develop prevention strategies to mitigate the harms associated with excessive alcohol consumption.",,© 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.,"['Drinking Consequences', 'High-intensity Alcohol Use', 'Party Characteristics', 'Youth and Young Adults']",,"31313331

The semen samples collected from seven Aardi bucks were pooled and diluted 1:4 with the Tris glycerol diluents containing the egg yolks of chicken (C), pigeon (P), goose (G), Japanese quail (Q), duck (D), or turkey (T). The diluted semen samples were gradually cooled to 5 °C within 2 h, equilibrated at 5 °C for 2 h, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor for 8 min before storing them at -196 °C. The frozen straws were thawed at 37 °C for 30 s and evaluated for sperm motility, vitality, abnormality, plasma-membrane integrity, and DNA fragmentation. The malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) activities were measured. The egg yolk samples of the above-mentioned avian species (n = 7/species) were analyzed for moisture, ash, protein, fatty acid (FA), and trace element contents. The use of the chicken EY (C) diluent resulted in better post-thawing buck semen quality, including the total progressive sperm motility parameters, sperm vitality, plasma membrane intactness, DNA integrity, and sperm abnormalities percentages, in comparison with the EY diluents of the other avian species. The lowest MDA and the highest GSH activities were observed in the C diluent. The chicken EY had the highest percentages of margaric and linolenic FAs and the lowest percentages of palmitoleic and myristic FAs. Moreover, the percentage of oleic FA was lower in the chicken EY than in the EYs of other species, except turkey. Additionally, the chicken EY had the significantly lowest concentration of Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn. In conclusion, the use of chicken egg yolk extender is recommended for buck semen cryopreservation. The egg yolks of the other avian species studied cannot substitute the chicken EY as they gave poorer post-thawing semen quality. The EY composition, especially FA profile and trace elements concentration, significantly affected the post-thawing quality of buck semen.",,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The incidence of menC IMD declined significantly in all age groups after menC vaccine introduction in 2000. MenB incidence also declined over the 20 EYs with decreasing trends in all age groups under 65, including an almost 50% decrease in infants over the final four EYs. IMD incidence in the ROI has declined, partly attributable to menC vaccination success, coupled with a spontaneous decline in menB.

Many inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) cause visual loss due to dysfunction or progressive degeneration of photoreceptor cells. These diseases show clinical and genetic heterogeneity.
The Israeli IRD consortium (IIRDC) was established with the goal of performing clinical and genetic mapping of IRDs in the Israeli population.
Clinical evaluation is carried out at electroretinography (ERG) centers and ophthalmology departments, where the patients undergo a comprehensive eye exam, including testing of visual acuity, refractive error, imaging techniques and ERG tests. Genetic analysis is performed using Sanger sequencing, analysis of founder mutations, and whole exome sequencing.
We recruited over 2,000 families including more than 3,000 individuals with IRDs. The most common inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive (65% of families). The most common retinal phenotype is retinitis pigmentosa (RP- 45% of families), followed by cone/cone-rod dystrophy, Stargardt Disease and Usher syndrome. We identified the cause of disease in 51% of families, mainly due to mutations in ABCA4, USH2A, FAM161A, CNGA3, and EYS. IIRDC researchers were involved in the identification of 16 novel IRD genes. In parallel, IIRDC members are involved in the development of therapeutic modalities for these currently incurable diseases.

IRD covers a set of genetically highly heterogeneous disorders with more than 150 genes associated with one or more clinical forms of IRD. Molecular genetic diagnosis has become increasingly important especially due to expanding number of gene therapy strategies under development. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of gene panels has proven a valuable diagnostic tool in IRD. We present the molecular findings of 677 individuals, residing in Denmark, with IRD and report 806 variants of which 187 are novel. We found that deletions and duplications spanning one or more exons can explain 3% of the cases, and thus copy number variation (CNV) analysis is important in molecular genetic diagnostics of IRD. Seven percent of the individuals have variants classified as pathogenic or likely-pathogenic in more than one gene. Possible Danish founder variants in EYS and RP1 are reported. A significant number of variants were classified as variants with unknown significance; reporting of these will hopefully contribute to the elucidation of the actual clinical consequence making the classification less troublesome in the future. In conclusion, this study underlines the relevance of performing targeted sequencing of IRD including CNV analysis as well as the importance of interaction with clinical diagnoses.",,,[],,"30718709

The groupness factors were differentially associated with theoretically relevant aspects of classes (e.g. synchronised movement), the individual (e.g. number of members interacted with), as well as group cohesion. Groupness also predicted perceived exertion and affect.
Our research provides support for a brief measure of groupness, advances theory related to how individuals perceive exercise groups, and provides evidence regarding how broader experiences during exercise may relate to exercisers' perceptions of groupness.","Our research provides support for a brief measure of groupness, advances theory related to how individuals perceive exercise groups, and provides evidence regarding how broader experiences during exercise may relate to exercisers' perceptions of groupness.",,"['Social influence', 'exercise psychology', 'group dynamics', 'multilevel', 'scale validation']",,30693798,"Exploratory structural equation modelling provided support for a two-factor solution reflecting entitativity and group structure as subdimensions of groupness.

Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become an efficient tool to encounter the enormous genetic heterogeneity of diverse retinal dystrophies, including RP. To identify disease-causing mutations in unselected, consecutive RP patients, we conducted Sanger sequencing of genes commonly involved in the suspected genetic RP subtype, followed by targeted large-panel NGS if no mutation was identified, or NGS as primary analysis. A high (70%) detection rate of disease-causing mutations was achieved in a large cohort of 116 unrelated patients. About half (48%) of the solved RP cases were explained by mutations in four genes: RPGR, EYS, PRPF31 and USH2A. Overall, 110 different mutations distributed across 30 different genes were detected, and 46 of these mutations were novel. A molecular diagnosis was achieved in the majority (82-100%) of patients if the family history was suggestive for a particular mode of inheritance, but only in 60% in cases of sporadic RP. The diagnostic potential of extensive molecular analysis in a routine setting is also illustrated by the identification of unexpected genotype-phenotype correlations for RP patients with mutations in CRX, CEP290, RPGRIP1, MFSD8. Furthermore, we identified numerous mutations in autosomal dominant (PRPF31, PRPH2, CRX) and X-linked (RPGR) RP genes in patients with sporadic RP. Variants in RP2 and RPGR were also found in female RP patients with apparently sporadic or dominant disease. In summary, this study demonstrates that massively parallel sequencing of all known retinal dystrophy genes is a valuable diagnostic approach for RP patients.",,,[],,"30543658

Part A,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) has become routine in clinical practice, especially in studies of recessive hereditary diseases in inbred consanguineous families, where homozygosity of a founder mutation is assumed. Multiple members of two consanguineous families of a single Bedouin tribe were diagnosed with apparently autosomal recessive/pseudo-dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Affected individuals exhibited severe visual impairment with nyctalopia, marked constriction of visual fields, markedly reduced and delayed responses on electro-retinography (ERG) and eventual loss of central vision. Combined copy-number variant (CNV) analysis, haplotype reconstruction and WES of the kindred identified two distinct novel mutations in EYS (RP25): a p.(W1817*) nonsense mutation (identified through WES) and a large deletion encompassing 9 of the 43 exons, that was missed by WES and was identified through microarray CNV analysis. Segregation analysis of both mutations demonstrated that all affected individuals were either homozygous for one of the mutations, or compound heterozygous for both. The two mutations are predicted to cause loss of function of the encoded protein and were not present in screening of 200 ethnically-matched controls. Our findings of two distinct mutations in the same gene in a single inbred kindred, identified only through combined WES and microarray CNV analysis, highlight the limitations of either CNV or WES alone, as the heterozygous deletion had normal WES read-depth values. Moreover, they demonstrate pitfalls in homozygosity mapping for disease-causing variant identification in inbred communities.",,"© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['CNV', 'EYS', 'WES', 'haplotyping']",,30513137,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448B15CC0>,,,,,,

Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited retinal dystrophy that leads to visual impairment. The EYS gene was reported to be the most common gene responsible for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP). arRP with defects in the EYS gene is denoted by ""EYS-RP"". We previously established a ""redirect differentiation"" method to generate photosensitive photoreceptor-like cells from commercially available human dermal fibroblasts. In this study, we produced photoreceptor-like cells from dermal fibroblasts of EYS-RP patients as a replacement for the degenerative retinas using ""redirect differentiation"". We analyzed defective transcripts of the EYS gene in these cells to elucidate phenotypes of EYS-RP patients because decay of transcripts was previously suggested to be involved in phenotypic variation associated with diseases.
Using ""redirect differentiation"" by CRX, RAX, NeuroD and OTX2, we made photoreceptor-directed fibroblasts derived from three normal volunteers and three EYS-RP patients with homozygous or heterozygous mutations. We tested inducible expression of the photoreceptor-specific genes (blue opsin, rhodopsin, recoverin, S-antigen, PDE6C) in these cells. We then analyzed transcripts derived from three different types of the defective EYS gene, c.1211dupA, c.4957dupA and c.8805C > A, expressed in these cells by RT-PCR and sequencing.
Photoreceptor-specific genes including the EYS gene were up-regulated in all the photoreceptor-directed fibroblasts tested. However, expression levels of defective transcripts were markedly different depending on the type of mutation. Transcripts derived from these three defective genes were scarcely detected, expressed at a lower level, and expressed at almost the same level as in normal volunteers, respectively.
Expression levels of genetically defective EYS gene transcripts in photoreceptor-directed fibroblasts of EYS-RP patients vary depending on the type of mutation. Variation in expression levels in transcripts having c.1211dupA, c.4957dupA and c.8805C > A suggests that almost complete nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), partial NMD and escape from NMD occurred for these transcripts, respectively. To determine the relationship with phenotypic variations in EYS-RP patients, more samples are needed. The present study also suggests that the redirect differentiation method could be a valuable tool for disease modeling despite some limitations.",,,"['EYS', 'Redirect differentiation', 'dermal fibroblast', 'disease modeling', 'genotype-phenotype relationship', 'nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)', 'phenotypic variation', 'photoreceptor', 'retinitis pigmentosa', 'truncating mutation']",,"30359287

Here we address this question by investigating the cellular mechanism responsible for the transition between fused and open rhabdoms in ommatidia of apposition compound eyes; a critical step required for the development of visual systems based on neural superposition. Utilizing Drosophila and Tribolium as representatives of fused and open rhabdom morphology in holometabolous insects respectively, we identified three changes required for this innovation to occur. First, the expression pattern of the extracellular matrix protein Eyes Shut (EYS) was co-opted and expanded from mechanosensory neurons to photoreceptor cells in taxa with open rhabdoms. Second, EYS homologs obtained a novel extension of the amino terminus leading to the internalization of a cleaved signal sequence. This amino terminus extension does not interfere with cleavage or function in mechanosensory neurons, but it does permit specific targeting of the EYS protein to the apical photoreceptor membrane. Finally, a specific interaction evolved between EYS and a subset of Prominin homologs that is required for the development of open, but not fused, rhabdoms. Together, our findings portray a case study wherein the evolution of a set of molecular novelties has precipitated the origin of an adaptive photoreceptor cell arrangement.",,Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The transcript is predicted to encode a 2,905-aa protein that contains 39 EGF-like domains and five laminin A G-like domains, which overall shows 33% identity with human EYS. To study the function of EYS, we generated a stable eysrmc101/rmc101 mutant zebrafish model using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The introduced lesion is predicted to result in premature termination of protein synthesis and lead to loss of Eys function. Immunohistochemistry on retinal sections revealed that Eys localizes at the region of the connecting cilium and that both rhodopsin and cone transducin are mislocalized in the absence of Eys. Electroretinogram recordings showed diminished b-wave amplitudes in eysrmc101/rmc101 zebrafish (5 dpf) compared to age- and strain-matched wild-type larvae. In addition, decreased locomotor activity in response to light stimuli was observed in eys mutant larvae. Altogether, our study shows that absence of Eys leads to a disorganized retinal architecture and causes visual dysfunction in zebrafish.",,,[],,"30052645

Arrhythmia and electrophysiology,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Although treatment options for AF exist, many patients cannot be maintained in normal sinus rhythm. Amiodarone is an effective medication for AF but has limited clinical utility because of off-target tissue toxicity.
Here, we use a pig model of AF to test the efficacy of an amiodarone-containing polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel. The gel is placed directly on the atrial epicardium through the pericardial space in a minimally invasive procedure using a specially designed catheter.
Implantation of amiodarone-containing gel significantly reduced the duration of sustained AF at 21 and 28 days; inducibility of AF was reduced 14 and 21 days post-delivery. Off-target organ drug levels in the liver, lungs, thyroid, and fat were significantly reduced in animals treated with epicardial amiodarone gel compared with systemic controls in small-animal distribution studies.
The pericardium is an underutilized therapeutic site and may be a new treatment strategy for AF and other cardiovascular diseases.",,"© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.","['amiodarone', 'arrhythmias, cardiac', 'atrial fibrillation', 'hydrogel, polyethylene glycol', 'pericardium']",,"29748197

A tensile specimen with equal probability in yield (EYS) was first designed considering variation both in thickness and in material strength. The uniaxial tension test was carried out with a digital image correlation method to analyze the mechanical behaviors. The results showed that the strain distribution of EYS was homogeneous. From the results, it can be known that a new design philosophy for a TRB tensile specimen is reasonable and EYS is suitable to characterize the mechanical behavior of TRB. The true stress-strain curves of metal in different cross sections of TRB were calculated. On the basis of the true stress-strain curves, a material model of TRB was constructed and then implemented into finite element simulations of TRB uniaxial tensile tests. The strain distribution of numerical and experimental results was similar and the error between the elongation of the specimen after fracture obtained by experiment and FE ranged from 9.51% to 13.06%. Therefore, the simulation results match well with the experimental results and the material model has high accuracy and as well as practicability.",,,"['digital image correlation method', 'finite elements', 'mechanical behavior', 'tailor rolled blanks (TRB)', 'uniaxial tensile specimen']",,29710772,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448BC2310>,,,,,,

Jugular catheters were inserted into 5 ruminally fistulated Holstein cows [94.2 ± 26.3 DIM; 717 ± 45 kg of body weight (BW); mean ± SD] in a 5 × 5 Latin square with 3-d periods. Cows were infused for 24 h with 1 of 5 treatments: water (CON), 1 g/kg of BW of butyrate infused into either the abomasum (A1) or rumen (R1), or 2 g/kg of BW of butyrate infused into either the abomasum or rumen. Sodium butyrate was the source of butyrate and NaCl was added to the CON, A1, and R1 treatments to provide the same amount of sodium as supplied by the sodium butyrate treatment in the 2-g treatments. Plastisol flanges were inserted into the abomasum to allow infusion to the abomasum and peristaltic pumps provided continuous infusion at 9.3 mL/min for all treatments.

This prospective case-series study included consecutive nine eyes of nine BCD patients with CYP4V2 mutations (BCD group), 16 eyes of 16 RP patients with EYS mutations (EYS-RP group), and 16 eyes of 16 normal volunteers matched for age and axial length (control group). Using swept-source optical coherence tomography, we obtained en face images of the choroidal vasculature at the midpoint of the choriocapillaris layer-Sattler's layer (inner choroid) and Haller's layer (outer choroid). After binarization, we compared the inner and outer choroidal vascular areas among the three groups and identified associated factors.
The outer choroidal vascular area was 43.34 ± 5.76%, 53.73 ± 4.92%, and 52.80 ± 4.10% in the BCD, EYS-RP, and control groups, respectively. This value was significantly smaller in the BCD group than in the EYS-RP and control groups (P < 0.001 in both; no significant difference between the EYS-RP and control groups).

Here, we explored the genomic landscape of IRD genes listed in RetNet to identify and prioritize those genes susceptible to CNV formation.MethodsRetNet genes underwent an assessment of genomic features and of CNV occurrence in the Database of Genomic Variants and literature. CNVs identified in an IRD cohort were characterized using targeted locus amplification (TLA) on extracted genomic DNA.ResultsExhaustive literature mining revealed 1,345 reported CNVs in 81 different IRD genes. Correlation analysis between rankings of genomic features and CNV occurrence demonstrated the strongest correlation between gene size and CNV occurrence of IRD genes. Moreover, we identified and delineated 30 new CNVs in IRD cases, 13 of which are novel and three of which affect noncoding, putative cis-regulatory regions. Finally, the breakpoints of six complex CNVs were determined using TLA in a hypothesis-neutral manner.ConclusionWe propose a ranking of CNV-prone IRD genes and demonstrate the efficacy of TLA for the characterization of CNVs on extracted DNA. Finally, this IRD-oriented CNV study can serve as a paradigm for other genetically heterogeneous Mendelian diseases with hidden genetic variation.",,,[],,"28749477

Within a population-based birth cohort, eNO levels were measured in healthy term infants aged 5 weeks during quiet tidal breathing in unsedated sleep. We assessed associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms with eNO levels in a genome-wide association study and subsequent symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections during the first year of life and asked whether this was modified by prenatal and early-life environmental factors.

Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are enriched at the plasma membrane of patients with end-stage HF, but the functional consequences of this are largely unknown, particularly for NDPK-C. Here, we investigated the potential role of NDPK-C in cardiac cAMP formation and contractility.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction, (far) Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry were used to study the expression, interaction with G proteins, and localization of NDPKs. cAMP levels were determined with immunoassays or fluorescent resonance energy transfer, and contractility was determined in cardiomyocytes (cell shortening) and in vivo (fractional shortening).
NDPK-C was essential for the formation of an NDPK-B/G protein complex. Protein and mRNA levels of NDPK-C were upregulated in end-stage human HF, in rats after long-term isoprenaline stimulation through osmotic minipumps, and after incubation of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes with isoprenaline. Isoprenaline also promoted translocation of NDPK-C to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of NDPK-C in cardiomyocytes increased cAMP levels and sensitized cardiomyocytes to isoprenaline-induced augmentation of contractility, whereas NDPK-C knockdown decreased cAMP levels. In vivo, depletion of NDPK-C in zebrafish embryos caused cardiac edema and ventricular dysfunction. NDPK-B knockout mice had unaltered NDPK-C expression but showed contractile dysfunction and exacerbated cardiac remodeling during long-term isoprenaline stimulation.

This study aimed at identifying disease-causing variants in fifteen consanguineous Tunisian families. Full ophthalmic examination was performed. Index patients were subjected to IROme analysis or whole exome sequencing followed by homozygosity mapping. All detected variations were confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. Mutation analysis in our patients revealed two compound heterozygous mutations p.(R91W);(V172D) in RPE65, and five novel homozygous mutations: p.R765C in CNGB1, p.H337R in PDE6B, splice site variant c.1129-2A > G and c.678_681delGAAG in FAM161A and c.1133 + 3_1133 + 6delAAGT in CERKL. The latter mutation impacts pre-mRNA splicing of CERKL. The other changes detected were six previously reported mutations in CNGB3 (p.R203*), ABCA4 (p.W782*), NR2E3 (p.R311Q), RPE65 (p.H182Y), PROM1 (c.1354dupT) and EYS (c.5928-2A > G). Segregation analysis in each family showed that all affected individuals were homozygotes and unaffected individuals were either heterozygote carriers or homozygous wild type allele.

The aim of this study was to investigate the isoform structure, expression and potential function of EYS in the mammalian retina in order to better understand its involvement in the pathogenesis of arRP.
To achieve the objective, we examined the expression of mRNA transcripts of EYS isoforms in human tissues and cell lines by RT-PCR. We also investigated the localisation of EYS in cultured cells and retinal cryo-sections by confocal fluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis.
RT-PCR analysis confirmed that EYS has at least four isoforms. In addition to the previously reported EYS isoforms 1 and 4, we present the experimental validation of two smaller variants referred to as EYS isoforms 2 and 3. All four isoforms are expressed in the human retina and Y79 cells and the short variants were additionally detected in the testis. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis revealed that all EYS isoforms preferentially localise to the cytoplasm of Y79 and HeLa cells. Moreover, an enrichment of the endogenous protein was observed near the centrosomes in Y79 cells. Interestingly, EYS was observed at the ciliary axoneme in Y79 ciliated cells. In macaque retinal cryosections, EYS was found to localise in the region of the photoreceptor ciliary axoneme in both rods and cones as well as in the cytoplasm of the ganglion cells.
The results obtained in this study lead us to speculate that, in photoreceptor cells, EYS could be a protein involved in maintaining the stability of the ciliary axoneme in both rods and cones. The variability of its isoform structure suggests that other roles are also possible and yet to be established.","The results obtained in this study lead us to speculate that, in photoreceptor cells, EYS could be a protein involved in maintaining the stability of the ciliary axoneme in both rods and cones.

These encouraging findings led to further investigations related to butyrate supplementation in the mature ruminant. However, the effects of elevated butyrate concentrations on rumen metabolism have not been investigated, and consequently the maximum tolerable dosage rate of butyrate has not been established. Therefore, the first objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of a short-term increase in rumen butyrate concentration on key metabolic indicators. The second objective was to evaluate the source of butyrate, either directly dosed in the rumen or indirectly supplied via lactose fermentation in the rumen. Jugular catheters were inserted into 4 ruminally fistulated Holstein cows in a 4×4 Latin square with 3-d periods. On d 1 of each period, 1h after feeding, cows were ruminally dosed with 1 of 4 treatments: (1) 2L of water (CON), (2) 3.5g/kg of body weight (BW) of lactose (LAC), (3) 1g/kg of BW of butyrate (1GB), or (4) 2g/kg of BW of butyrate (2GB). Sodium butyrate was the source of butyrate, and NaCl was added to CON (1.34g/kg of BW), LAC (1.34g/kg of BW), and 1GB (0.67g/kg of BW) to provide equal amounts of sodium as the 2GB treatment. Serial plasma and rumen fluid samples were collected during d 1 of each period. Rumen fluid pH was greater in cows given the 1GB and 2GB treatments compared with the cows given the LAC treatment. Cows administered the 1GB and 2GB treatments had greater rumen butyrate concentrations compared with LAC. Those cows also had greater plasma butyrate concentrations compared with cows given the LAC treatment. Plasma β-hydroxybutyrate was greater and insulin tended to be greater for butyrate treatments compared with LAC. No difference in insulin was found between the 1GB and 2GB treatments. Based on plasma and rumen metabolites, singly infusing 3.5g/kg of BW of lactose into the rumen is not as effective at providing a source of butyrate as compared with singly infusing 1 or 2g/kg of BW of butyrate into the rumen. Additionally, rumen pH, rumen butyrate, plasma β-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and plasma butyrate were less affected in cows administered the 1GB treatment than in cows given the 2GB treatment. This finding suggests that singly dosing 1g/kg of BW of butyrate could serve as the maximum tolerable concentration for future research.",,Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Immunostaining indicated that EYS localized near the connecting cilium/transition zone in photoreceptors. EYS also strongly localized to the cone outer segments and weakly to the rod outer segments and cone terminals in primate retinas. Analysis of mutant EYS zebrafish revealed disruption of the ciliary pocket in cone photoreceptors, indicating that EYS is required for maintaining the integrity of the ciliary pocket lumen.

The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the measurements was calculated.ResultsThe mean rate of ISe shortening was -4.65±2.89% per year and the decline was statistically significant. The rate of shortening was significantly negatively correlated with the baseline length (P=0.046, r=0.58), but not with the baseline age, visual acuity, and MD value. The ICC (2, 1) was 0.999.ConclusionsISe of all RP patients with EYS mutations shortened during the 5 years of annual observation. The measurement of the length of ISe is a simple and convenient method with high repeatability, and the length is a sensitive prognostic factor for the rate of ISe shortening in RP patients with EYS mutations.",,,[],,"27564720

Among the frequent variants examined using the genome-wide association study approach, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C represents the only validated predictor of SAM in patients treated with high-dose simvastatin. Our aim was to ascertain the overall contribution of large copy-number variations (CNVs) to SAM diagnosed in 86 patients. CNVs were detected by whole genome genotyping using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 Exome BeadChips. Exome sequence data were used for validation of CNVs in SAM-related loci. In addition, we performed a specific search for CNVs in the SLCO1B region detected recently in Rotor syndrome subjects. Rare deletions possibly contributing to genetic predisposition to SAM were found in two patients: one removed EYS associated previously with SAM, the other was present in LARGE associated with congenital muscular dystrophy. Another two patients carried deletions in CYP2C19, which may predispose to clopidogrel-statin interactions. We found no common large CNVs potentially associated with SAM and no CNVs in the SLCO1B locus. Our findings suggest that large CNVs do not play a substantial role in the etiology of SAM.",,,[],,27539103,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448E1D450>,,,,,,

Drawing from met expectations theory, we applied response surface methodology to examine how role expectations, in relation to role experiences, influence perceptions of group cohesion among Canadian Interuniversity Sport athletes (N = 153). On the basis of data from two time points, as athletes approached and exceeded their role contribution expectations, they reported higher perceptions of task cohesion. Furthermore, as athletes approached and exceeded their social involvement expectations, they reported higher perceptions of social cohesion. These response surface patterns-pertaining to task and social cohesion-were driven by the positive influence of role experiences. On the basis of the interplay between athletes' role experiences and their perception of the group environment, efforts to improve team dynamics may benefit from focusing on improving the quality of role experiences, in conjunction with developing realistic role expectations.",,,[],,27385677,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448E29450>,,,,,,
0,Targeted next-generation sequencing extends the phenotypic and mutational spectrums for EYS mutations.,"Shun Gu, Yuanyuan Tian, Xue Chen, Chen Zhao",,2016-07-05,Molecular vision,"We aim to determine genetic lesions with a phenotypic correlation in four Chinese families with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP).
Medical histories were carefully reviewed. All patients received comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach targeting a panel of 205 retinal disease-relevant genes and 15 candidate genes was selectively performed on probands from the four recruited families for mutation detection. Online predictive software and crystal structure modeling were also applied to test the potential pathogenic effects of identified mutations.
Of the four families, two were diagnosed with RP sino pigmento (RPSP). Patients with RPSP claimed to have earlier RP age of onset but slower disease progression. Five mutations in the eyes shut homolog (EYS) gene, involving two novel (c.7228+1G>A and c.9248G>A) and three recurrent mutations (c.4957dupA, c.6416G>A and c.6557G>A), were found as RP causative in the four families. The missense variant c.5093T>C was determined to be a variant of unknown significance (VUS) due to the variant's colocalization in the same allele with the reported pathogenic mutation c.6416G>A. The two novel variants were further confirmed absent in 100 unrelated healthy controls. Online predictive software indicated potential pathogenicity of the three missense mutations. Further, crystal structural modeling suggested generation of two abnormal hydrogen bonds by the missense mutation p.G2186E (c.6557G>A) and elongation of its neighboring β-sheet induced by p.G3083D (c.9248G>A), which could alter the tertiary structure of the eys protein and thus interrupt its physicochemical properties.
Taken together, with the targeted NGS approach, we reveal novel EYS mutations and prove the efficiency of targeted NGS in the genetic diagnoses of RP. We also first report the correlation between EYS mutations and RPSP. The genotypic-phenotypic relationship in all Chinese patients carrying mutations in the EYS gene were also reviewed and summarized.",,,[],,"27375351

Recent sequencing techniques such as whole exome sequencing (WES) contribute to the discovery of novel genes. The aim of the current study was to use WES data to identify large deletions that include at least one exon in known IRD genes.
Patients diagnosed with IRDs underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation. WES was performed using the NimbleGen V2 paired-end kit and HiSeq 2000. An analysis of exon coverage data was performed on 60 WES samples. Exonic deletions were verified by 'PCR walking' analysis.
We analysed data obtained from 60 WES samples of index patients with IRDs. By calculating the average coverage for all exons in the human genome, we were able to identify homozygous and hemizygous deletions of at least one exon in six families (10%), including a single-exon deletion in EYS, deletions of three consecutive exons in MYO7A and NPHP4, deletions of four and eight consecutive exons in RPGR and a multigene deletion on the X-chromosome, including CHM. By using PCR-walking analysis, we were able to identify the borders of five of the deletions and to screen our set of patients for these deletions.
We performed here a comprehensive analysis of WES data as a tool for identifying large genomic deletions in patients with IRDs.

The authors investigated the impact of a new combination therapy of bortezomib, IVIG, and rituximab on transplantation rate.This study was a prospective, open-labeled clinical trial. The desensitization regimen consisted of 2 doses of IVIG (2  g/kg), a single dose of rituximab (375  mg/m), and 4 doses of bortezomib (1.3  mg/m). The transplant rate was analyzed. Anti-Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB antibodies were determined by a Luminex solid-phase bead assay at baseline and after 2, 3, and 6 months in the desensitized patients.There were 19 highly sensitized patients who received desensitization and 17 patients in the control group. Baseline values of class I and II panel reactive antibody (%, peak mean fluorescence intensity) were 83  ±  16.0 (14952  ±  5820) and 63  ±  36.0 (10321  ±  7421), respectively. Deceased donor kidney transplantation was successfully performed in 8 patients (42.1%) in the desensitization group versus 4 (23.5%) in the control group. Multivariate time-varying covariate Cox regression analysis showed that desensitization increased the probability of DDKT (hazard ratio, 46.895; 95% confidence interval, 3.468-634.132; P = 0.004). Desensitization decreased mean fluorescence intensity values of class I panel reactive antibody by 15.5% (20.8%) at 2 months. In addition, a liberal mismatch strategy in post hoc analysis increased the benefit of desensitization in donor-specific antibody reduction. Desensitization was well tolerated, and acute rejection occurred only in the control group.In conclusion, a desensitization protocol using bortezomib, high-dose IVIG, and rituximab increased the DDKT rate in highly sensitized, wait-listed patients.",,,[],,"26844479

Disease-causing mutations were found in 27 out of 47 cases achieving a mutation detection rate of 57.4%. In total, 33 pathogenic mutations were identified, 20 of which were novel mutations (60.6%). Furthermore, not only single nucleotide variations but also copy-number variations, including three large deletions in the USH2A and EYS genes, were identified. Finally seven out of 27 families, displaying mutations in the ABCA4, RP1, RP2 and USH2A genes, could be genetically or clinically reclassified.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the probands of the arRP families and sporadic RP patients, and direct Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the causal mutations identified by WES. We found that the mutations of EYS are likely pathogenic mutations in two arRP families and eight sporadic patients. Specifically, we found a novel pair of compound heterozygous mutations and a novel homozygous mutation in two separate arRP families, and found two novel heterozygous mutations in two sporadic RP patients, whereas we found six novel homozygous mutations in six sporadic RP patients. Of these, one was a frameshift mutation, two were stop-gain mutations, one was a splicing mutation, and the others were missense mutations.

Characteristic symptoms include night blindness and progressive loss of visual field, leading to blindness. Mutations in >60 genes have been identified to date as causative for RP, and additional candidate genes are assumed.
To find the disease-causing mutations in the affected members of five Turkish families, we sequenced whole exomes using an Illumina platform.
Among all candidate genes for retinal degeneration we found two previously known sequence variations: a 4 bp deletion in the RPGR gene (c.1662_1665delAGAA; p.Glu555Glyfs*14) and a recently described USH1-causing missense mutation in MYO7A (c.472G>A, p.Gly158Arg). Furthermore, a novel 1 bp deletion in the VCAN gene (c.5118delA; p.Ser1707Valfs*44) was detected as well as a large deletion in EYS, spanning ∼ 400kb and comprising exons 16-26 (p.fs*). In one family, exome analyses of two affected individuals revealed a homozygous missense mutation (c.883G>A; p.Asp295Asn) in the AGBL5 (Agbl5; CCP5) gene, previously not reported to be associated with RP. RNA and protein analyses showed expression in human retina, as well as in mouse retina, brain and testis. Furthermore, cDNA analyses indicate the existence of tissue-specific AGBL5 splice variations in humans. AGBL5/CCP5 immunoreactivity was also visualized in human and mouse retinae.

This study was performed to investigate the relationship between the BRAFV600E mutation and F-18 FDG uptake in PTC.We retrospectively included 169 PTC patients who underwent F-18 FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) before thyroidectomy from May 2009 to August 2012. Subjects were classified into overt PTC (>1 cm, n = 76) and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC, n = 93) groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationship between maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumors and clinicopathologic variables.The BRAFV600E mutation was detected in 82.2% (139/169). In all subjects, the BRAFV600E mutation and tumor size were independently related to SUVmax by multivariate analysis (P = 0.048 and P < 0.001, respectively). SUVmax was significantly higher in tumors with the BRAFV600E mutation than in those with wild-type BRAF (9.4 ± 10.9 vs 5.0 ± 4.1, P < 0.001). Similarly, in overt PTC group, the BRAFV600E mutation and tumor size were independently correlated with SUVmax (P = 0.032 and P = 0.001, respectively). By contrast, in PTMC group, only tumor size was significantly associated with SUVmax (P = 0.010). The presence of the BRAFV600E mutation is independently associated with high F-18 FDG uptake on preoperative PET/CT in patients with overt PTC, but this relationship was not evident in PTMC.

Iladevi Cataract and IOL Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India.
Prospective longitudinal study.
This study assessed children with microphthalmos who had bilateral congenital cataract surgery. Microphthalmos was defined as an eye that has an axial length (AL) that was 2 standard deviations smaller than what is normally expected at that age. All eyes were left aphakic. One of the 2 eyes was randomly selected for analysis. Postoperative complications, AL, CCT, and visual acuity were documented.
This study included 72 eys of 36 children. The mean age of the patients was 4.8 months ± 6.2 (SD) (range 0.5 to 15 months). Postoperative complications included secondary glaucoma (11/36, 30.6%), visual axis obscuration (4/36, 11.1%), and posterior synechiae (10/36, 27.8%). A significant rate of change was observed in axial growth up to 4 years and in CCT up to 3 years postoperatively. When age at the time of surgery was correlated with the profile of the rate of change in AL and CCT at 1 month and 1, 2, and 4 years, statistically significant differences in AL and CCT at all timepoints were found. Loss of vision after surgery occurred in 2 eyes.
After early surgical intervention, an acceptable rate of serious postoperative complications and good visual outcomes were obtained in microphthalmic eyes.

When part of a team, athletes make their appraisal within a social context, and in this study we examined whether perceived team cohesion, as a characteristic of this context, related to appraisal. We asked 386 male and female intercollegiate team-sport athletes to respond to measures of cohesion and precompetitive appraisal before an in-season game. For males and females, across all teams, (a) an appraisal of increased competition importance was predicted by perceptions of higher task cohesion (individual level), better previous team performance, and a weaker opponent (team level) and (b) an appraisal of more positive prospects for coping with competitive demands was predicted by higher individual attractions to the group (individual level). Consequently, athletes who perceive their team as more cohesive likely appraise the pending competition as a challenge, which would benefit both emotions and performance.",,,[],,26524095,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448EEC180>,,,,,,

The study aim was to determine predictors for micronuclei (MN) occurrence and frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes of health workers professionally exposed to radiation.
Health workers, age matched, selected for the study on regular check-ups, were divided according to the radiation exposure. The exposed group involved nuclear medicine department employees (54) and the control group comprised workers from other departments (36). Data about workers characteristics and habits, received annual doses (AD), total years of service (TYS) and exposed years of service (EYS) were taken from each subject. Blood samples were taken and micronuclei (MN) number in peripheral blood lymphocytes was calculated using CBMN assay according to standard protocols.
Most workers were female, technicians, with mean age of 45.67 years and EYS about 15 years. Health workers exposed to radiation had significantly more MN than controls (p = 0.001). Female gender, older age, higher received annual doses, longer EYS and TYS increased the MN number. Technicians and laboratory workers have higher risk for MN occurrence. Significant predictors of MN formation according to constructed model were workers age, sex, AD and EYS. One EYS year increases MN frequency 1.017 times, while receiving 0.1 mSy raises MN frequency by 26 %. EYS accurately predicts 86.30 % of MN frequencies and AD 64.60 %.

Clinical and molecular evaluations were performed on 349 patients with IRD. For segregation analyses, 63 of their family members were employed. Bioinformatics data from 1,208 Japanese individuals were used as controls. Molecular diagnosis was obtained by direct sequencing in a stepwise fashion utilizing one or two panels of 15 and 27 genes for retinitis pigmentosa patients. If a specific clinical diagnosis was suspected, direct sequencing of disease-specific genes, that is, ABCA4 for Stargardt disease, was conducted. Limited availability of intrafamily information and decreasing family size hampered identifying inherited patterns. Differential disease profiles with lower prevalence of Stargardt disease from European and North American populations were obtained. We found 205 sequence variants in 159 of 349 probands with an identification rate of 45.6%. This study found 43 novel sequence variants. In silico analysis suggests that 20 of 25 novel missense variants are pathogenic. EYS mutations had the highest prevalence at 23.5%. c.4957_4958insA and c.8868C>A were the two major EYS mutations identified in this cohort.

The intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK4) channel is required for pathological VSMC proliferation. In T lymphocytes, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDPKB) has been implicated in SK4 channel activation. We thus investigated the role of NDPKB in the regulation of SK4 currents (ISK4) in proliferating VSMC and neointima formation.
Function and expression of SK4 channels in VSMC from injured mouse carotid arteries were assessed by patch-clamping and real-time polymerase chain reaction. ISK4 was detectable in VSMC from injured but not from uninjured arteries correlating with the occurrence of the proliferative phenotype. Direct application of NDPKB to the membrane of inside-out patches increased ISK4, whereas NDPKB did not alter currents in VSMC obtained from injured vessels of SK4-deficient mice. The NDPKB-induced increase in ISK4 was prevented by protein histidine phosphatase 1, but not an inactive protein histidine phosphatase 1 mutant indicating that ISK4 is regulated via histidine phosphorylation in proliferating VSMC; moreover, genetic NDPKB ablation reduced ISK4 by 50% suggesting a constitutive activation of ISK4 in proliferating VSMC. In line, neointima formation after wire injury of the carotid artery was substantially reduced in mice deficient in SK4 channels or NDPKB.
NDPKB to SK4 signaling is required for neointima formation. Constitutive activation of SK4 by NDPKB in proliferating VSMC suggests that targeting this interaction via, for example, activation of protein histidine phosphatase 1 may provide clinically meaningful effects in vasculoproliferative diseases such as atherosclerosis and post angioplasty restenosis.",,"© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.","['KCNN4 protein', 'KCa3.1 protein', 'NM23B nucleoside diphosphate kinase', 'Nme2 protein', 'SK4 protein', 'atherosclerosis', 'neointima formation']",,26088577,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448F1C4A0>,,,,,,

Although this process is heavily researched in organizational contexts, we sought to extend this line of inquiry to sport by examining the nature of socialization tactics used to integrate new members into existing teams. Interviews were conducted with 12 coaches and 12 athletes from several Canadian Interuniversity Sport teams to explore the nature of socialization and the circumstances underscoring why certain approaches are taken over others. A key process involved establishing congruency of role expectations between incoming athletes and group leaders, and socialization processes balanced expectations of conformity with encouragement of individual personalities within the group.

To link genetic variants in asthma candidate genes to progression of wheeze to persistent wheeze into childhood asthma.
In a prospective study, children with recurrent wheeze from the ADEM (Asthma DEtection and Monitoring) study were followed until the age of six. At that age a classification (transient wheeze or asthma) was based on symptoms, lung function and medication use. In 198 children the relationship between this classification and 30 polymorphisms in 16 asthma candidate genes was assessed by logistic regression. In case of an association based on a p<0.10, replication analysis was performed in an independent birth cohort study (KOALA study, n = 248 included for the present analysis).
In the ADEM study, the minor alleles of ADAM33 rs511898 and rs528557 and the ORMDL3/GSDMB rs7216389 polymorphisms were negatively associated, whereas the minor alleles of IL4 rs2243250 and rs2070874 polymorphisms were positively associated with childhood asthma. When replicated in the KOALA study, ADAM33 rs528557 showed a negative association of the CG/GG-genotype with progression of recurrent wheeze into childhood asthma (0.50 (0.26-0.97) p = 0.04) and no association with preschool wheeze.

Here, we aim to determine the genetic lesions with phenotypic correlations in two Chinese families with ARRP. Medical histories and ophthalmic documentations were obtained from all participants from the two pedigrees. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 189 genes was performed to screen for RP causative mutations in the two families. Two biallelic mutations in EYS, p.[R164*];[C2139Y] and p.[W2640*];[F2954S], were identified in the two families, respectively. EYS p.R164* and p.F2954S are novel alleles associated with RP, while p.C2139Y and p.W2640* are known mutations. Crystal structure modeling on the protein eyes shut homolog encoded by the EYS gene revealed abnormal hydrogen bonds generated by p.C2139Y and p.F2954S, which would likely affect the solubility and cause significant structural changes of the two mutated proteins. In conclusion, our study expands the genotypic spectrums for EYS mutations, and may provide novel insights into the relevant pathogenesis for RP.

Improper fixation conditions could lead to artifacts and thus incorrect conclusions in immunofluorescence or histology experiments. To resolve reported structural anomalies with respect to Drosophila photoreceptor cell organization we developed and utilized a combination of live imaging and fixed samples to investigate the exact biogenesis and to identify the underlying source for the reported discrepancies in structure.
We found that piperazine-N,N'-bis(ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES) and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), two zwitterionic buffers commonly used in tissue fixation, can cause severe lumen and cell morphological defects in Drosophila pupal and adult retina; the inter-rhabdomeral lumen becomes dilated and the photoreceptor cells are significantly reduced in size. Correspondingly, the localization pattern of Eyes shut (EYS), a luminal protein, is severely altered. In contrast, tissues fixed in the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer results in lumen and cell morphologies that are consistent with live imaging.
We suggest that PIPES and HEPES buffers should be utilized with caution for fixation when examining the interplay between cells and their extracellular environment, especially in Drosophila pupal and adult retina research.",,,[],,"25645690

Eyes from a 72-year-old female (donor 1, family 1), a 91-year-old female (donor 2, family 2), and her 97-year-old sister (donor 3, family 2) were evaluated with macroscopic, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Age-similar normal eyes and an eye donated by donor 1's asymptomatic mother (donor 4, family 1) were used as controls. The perifovea and peripheral retina were processed for microscopy and immunocytochemistry with markers for cone and rod photoreceptor cells. DNA analysis revealed EYS mutations c.2259 + 1G > A and c.2620C > T (p.Q874X) in family 1, and c.4350_4356del (p.I1451Pfs*3) and c.2739-?_3244 + ?del in family 2. Imaging studies revealed the presence of bone spicule pigment in arRP donor retinas. Histology of all three affected donor eyes showed very thin retinas with little evidence of stratified nuclear layers in the periphery. In contrast, the perifovea displayed a prominent inner nuclear layer. Immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrated advanced retinal degenerative changes in all eyes, with near-total absence of rod photoreceptors. In addition, we found that the perifoveal cones were more preserved in retinas from the donor with the midsize genomic rearrangement (c.4350_4356del (p.I1451Pfs*3) and c.2739-?_3244 + ?del) than in retinas from the donors with the truncating (c.2259 + 1G > A and c.2620C > T (p.Q874X) mutations.

0,The protein O-glucosyltransferase Rumi modifies eyes shut to promote rhabdomere separation in Drosophila.,"Amanda R Haltom, Tom V Lee, Beth M Harvey, Jessica Leonardi, Yi-Jiun Chen, Yang Hong, Robert S Haltiwanger, Hamed Jafar-Nejad",10.1371/journal.pgen.1004795,2014-11-21,PLoS genetics,"The protein O-glucosyltransferase Rumi/POGLUT1 regulates Drosophila Notch signaling by adding O-glucose residues to the Notch extracellular domain. Rumi has other predicted targets including Crumbs (Crb) and Eyes shut (Eys), both of which are involved in photoreceptor development. However, whether Rumi is required for the function of Crb and Eys remains unknown. Here we report that in the absence of Rumi or its enzymatic activity, several rhabdomeres in each ommatidium fail to separate from one another in a Notch-independent manner. Mass spectral analysis indicates the presence of O-glucose on Crb and Eys. However, mutating all O-glucosylation sites in a crb knock-in allele does not cause rhabdomere attachment, ruling out Crb as a biologically-relevant Rumi target in this process. In contrast, eys and rumi exhibit a dosage-sensitive genetic interaction. In addition, although in wild-type ommatidia most of the Eys protein is found in the inter-rhabdomeral space (IRS), in rumi mutants a significant fraction of Eys remains in the photoreceptor cells. The intracellular accumulation of Eys and the IRS defect worsen in rumi mutants raised at a higher temperature, and are accompanied by a ∼50% decrease in the total level of Eys. Moreover, removing one copy of an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone enhances the rhabdomere attachment in rumi mutant animals. Altogether, our data suggest that O-glucosylation of Eys by Rumi ensures rhabdomere separation by promoting proper Eys folding and stability in a critical time window during the mid-pupal stage. Human EYS, which is mutated in patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, also harbors multiple Rumi target sites. Therefore, the role of O-glucose in regulating Eys may be conserved.",,,[],,"25412384

To increase the understanding of the molecular epidemiology of the disease in Italy, we analyzed 56 patients with syndromic and non-syndromic forms of RP attending the Retinitis Pigmentosa Center of San Paolo Hospital (Milan, Italy). Patients underwent detailed clinical examination. Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples was screened for mutations in different genes according to RP form by direct sequencing analysis. The impact of novel missense mutations on protein functions was predicted by in silico analysis and protein sequence alignment. Cosegregation analysis was performed between available family members. Forty-one of the 56 probands analyzed had non-syndromic and 15 had syndromic RP forms. Putative disease-causing mutations were identified in 19 of 56 unrelated RP probands. Mutation screening identified a total of 22 different heterozygous variants. Notably, 12 of these putative pathogenic mutations have not been previously reported. New variants were found to be located on the USH2A, RPGR, EYS, and RHO genes. All 3 new variants detected in X-linked RP probands were confirmed in other affected family members. We found a positivity rate of 24.4% and 60% for probands with non-syndromic and syndromic RP, respectively. This is the first report of RPGR X-linked RP proband-ORF15 mutations in Italian patients with X-linked (XL)-RP.

We performed comprehensive molecular testing in 329 Japanese RP and Usher syndrome patients by using a custom capture panel that covered the coding exons and exon/intron boundaries of all 193 known inherited eye disease genes combined with Illumina HiSequation 2500. Candidate variants were screened using systematic data analyses, and their potential pathogenicity was assessed according to the frequency of the variants in normal populations, in silico prediction tools, and compatibility with known phenotypes or inheritance patterns.
Molecular diagnoses were made in 115/317 RP patients (36.3%) and 6/12 Usher syndrome patients (50%). We identified 104 distinct mutations, including 66 novel mutations. EYS, USH2A, and RHO were common causative genes. In particular, mutations in EYS accounted for 15.0% of the autosomal recessive/simplex RP patients or 10.7% of the entire RP cohort.

0,The actomyosin machinery is required for Drosophila retinal lumen formation.,"Jing Nie, Simpla Mahato, Andrew C Zelhof",10.1371/journal.pgen.1004608,2014-09-19,PLoS genetics,"Multicellular tubes consist of polarized cells wrapped around a central lumen and are essential structures underlying many developmental and physiological functions. In Drosophila compound eyes, each ommatidium forms a luminal matrix, the inter-rhabdomeral space, to shape and separate the key phototransduction organelles, the rhabdomeres, for proper visual perception. In an enhancer screen to define mechanisms of retina lumen formation, we identified Actin5C as a key molecule. Our results demonstrate that the disruption of lumen formation upon the reduction of Actin5C is not linked to any discernible defect in microvillus formation, the rhabdomere terminal web (RTW), or the overall morphogenesis and basal extension of the rhabdomere. Second, the failure of proper lumen formation is not the result of previously identified processes of retinal lumen formation: Prominin localization, expansion of the apical membrane, or secretion of the luminal matrix. Rather, the phenotype observed with Actin5C is phenocopied upon the decrease of the individual components of non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) and its upstream activators. In photoreceptor cells MyoII localizes to the base of the rhabdomeres, overlapping with the actin filaments of the RTW. Consistent with the well-established roll of actomyosin-mediated cellular contraction, reduction of MyoII results in reduced distance between apical membranes as measured by a decrease in lumen diameter. Together, our results indicate the actomyosin machinery coordinates with the localization of apical membrane components and the secretion of an extracellular matrix to overcome apical membrane adhesion to initiate and expand the retinal lumen.",,,[],,"25233220

We genotyped samples from 1,711 patients with AAU (either primary or combined with AS), 2,339 AS patients without AAU, and 10,000 control subjects on an Illumina Immunochip Infinium microarray. We also used data for AS patients from previous genome-wide association studies to investigate the AS risk locus ANTXR2 for its putative effect in AAU. ANTXR2 expression in mouse eyes was investigated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
A comparison between all patients with AAU and healthy control subjects showed strong association over HLA-B, corresponding to the HLA-B27 tag single-nucleotide polymorphism rs116488202. The association of 3 non-major histocompatibility complex loci, IL23R, the intergenic region 2p15, and ERAP1, reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Five loci harboring the immune-related genes IL10-IL19, IL18R1-IL1R1, IL6R, the chromosome 1q32 locus harboring KIF21B, as well as the eye-related gene EYS, were also associated, reaching a suggestive level of significance (P < 5 × 10(-6)). Several previously confirmed AS associations demonstrated significant differences in effect size between AS patients with AAU and AS patients without AAU. ANTXR2 expression varied across eye compartments.
These findings of both novel AAU-specific associations and associations shared with AS demonstrate overlapping but also distinct genetic susceptibility loci for AAU and AS. The associations in IL10 and IL18R1 are shared with inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting common etiologic pathways.","These findings of both novel AAU-specific associations and associations shared with AS demonstrate overlapping but also distinct genetic susceptibility loci for AAU and AS.

We recently reported that the extracellular matrix (ECM) protease, matrix metalloproteinase-3, is elevated in GLD and that it regulates psychosine-induced microglial activation. Here, we examined central nervous system ECM component expression in human GLD patients and in the twitcher mouse model of GLD using immunohistochemistry. The influence of ECM proteins on primary murine microglial responses to psychosine was evaluated using ECM proteins as substrates and analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and ELISA. Functional analysis of microglial cytotoxicity was performed on oligodendrocytes in coculture, and cell death was measured by lactose dehydrogenase assay. Tenascin-C (TnC) was expressed at higher levels in human GLD and in twitcher mice versus controls. Microglial responses to psychosine were enhanced by TnC, as determined by an increase in globoid-like cell formation, matrix metalloproteinase-3 mRNA expression, and higher toxicity toward oligodendrocytes in culture. These findings were consistent with a shift toward the M1 microglial phenotype in TnC-grown microglia. Thus, elevated TnC expression in GLD modified microglial responses to psychosine. These data offer a novel perspective and enhance understanding of the microglial contribution to GLD pathogenesis.",,,[],,"25192051

This shift results in excessive cardiac lipid accumulation and eventually heart failure. Lipid-induced cardiomyopathy may be averted by strategies that increase glucose uptake without elevating LCFA uptake. Protein kinase-D1 (PKD1) is involved in contraction-induced glucose, but not LCFA, uptake allowing to hypothesize that this kinase is an attractive target to treat lipid-induced cardiomyopathy. For this, cardiospecific constitutively active PKD1 overexpression (caPKD1)-mice were subjected to an insulin resistance-inducing high fat-diet for 20-weeks. Substrate utilization was assessed by microPET and cardiac function by echocardiography. Cardiomyocytes were isolated for measurement of substrate uptake, lipid accumulation and insulin sensitivity. Wild-type mice on a high fat-diet displayed increased basal myocellular LCFA uptake, increased lipid deposition, greatly impaired insulin signaling, and loss of insulin-stimulated glucose and LCFA uptake, which was associated with concentric hypertrophic remodeling. The caPKD1 mice on high-fat diet showed none of these characteristics, whereas on low-fat diet a shift towards cardiac glucose utilization in combination with hypertrophy and ventricular dilation was observed. In conclusion, these data suggest that PKD pathway activation may be an attractive therapeutic strategy to mitigate lipid accumulation, insulin resistance and maladaptive remodeling in the lipid-overloaded heart, but this requires further investigation.",,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of NDPKB in angiogenesis has to date not been defined. Therefore, we analyzed the contribution of NDPKB to angiogenesis and its underlying mechanisms in well-characterized in vivo and in vitro models.
Zebrafish embryos were depleted of NDPKB by morpholino-mediated knockdown. These larvae displayed severe malformations specifically in vessels formed by angiogenesis. NDPKB-deficient (NDPKB(-/-)) mice were subjected to oxygen-induced retinopathy. In this model, the number of preretinal neovascularizations in NDPKB(-/-) mice was strongly reduced in comparison with wild-type littermates. In accordance, a delayed blood flow recovery was detected in the NDPKB(-/-) mice after hindlimb ligation. In in vitro studies, a small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of NDPKB was performed in human umbilical endothelial cells. NDPKB depletion impaired vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced sprouting and hampered the VEGF-induced spatial redistributions of the VEGF receptor type 2 and VE-cadherin at the plasma membrane. Concomitantly, NDPKB depletion increased the permeability of the human umbilical endothelial cell monolayer.
This is the first report to show that NDPKB is required for VEGF-induced angiogenesis and contributes to the correct localization of VEGF receptor type 2 and VE-cadherin at the endothelial adherens junctions. Therefore, our data identify NDPKB as a novel molecular target to modulate VEGF-dependent angiogenesis.",,"© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.","['NDPKB', 'Nme2', 'VEGFR2', 'angiogenesis', 'endothelial permeability', 'nucleoside diphosphate kinase']",,25147336,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000001144907AEA0>,,,,,,

To identify disease-causing USH2A gene mutations in Japanese RP patients, all 73 exons were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. In total, 100 unrelated Japanese RP patients with no systemic manifestations were identified, excluding families with obvious autosomal dominant inheritance. Of these 100 patients, 82 were included in this present study after 18 RP patients with very likely pathogenic EYS (eyes shut homolog) mutations were excluded. The mutation analysis of the USH2A revealed five very likely pathogenic mutations in four patients. A patient had only one very likely pathogenic mutation and the others had two of them. Caucasian frequent mutations p.C759F in arRP and p.E767fs in USH2 were not found. All the four patients exhibited typical clinical features of RP.

Study 1 was a paper-and-pencil survey completed by 210 individual sport athletes from 12 university- and college-level teams. Multiple mediation analyses demonstrated that participants who had to work alongside teammates during competition reported increased interdependence perceptions that were, in turn, associated with increased cohesion and satisfaction as well as decreased competitiveness. There were no differences according to whether participants competed in the same event as all of their teammates or not. Study 2 involved a weekly e-mail survey with 17 university-level individual sport athletes who reported interdependence perceptions on a continual basis over the course of their competitive season. Interdependence perceptions were higher during weeks that were close in time to competitions with a collective group outcome.

At the initial visit, the patient's decimal best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.9 and 0.6 in his right and left eyes, respectively.

The Pax6 homolog Eyeless (Ey) is an example of such a factor and its expression pattern reveals it is dynamically controlled during development. Ey׳s paralog Twin of eyeless (Toy) induces its expression during embryogenesis, and the two genes are expressed in nearly identical patterns during the larval stages of development. While Ey must be expressed to initiate retinal specification, it must subsequently be repressed behind the morphogenetic furrow to allow for neuronal differentiation. Thus far, a few factors have been implicated in this repression including the signaling pathways Hedgehog (Hh) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp), and more recently downstream components of the retinal determination gene network (RDGN) Sine oculis (So), Eyes absent (Eya), and Dachshund (Dac). Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk), a conserved serine-threonine kinase, regulates numerous factors during tissue patterning and development, including the Hh pathway. Using genetic analyses we identify Hipk as a repressor of both Toy and Ey and show that it may do so, in part, through Hh signaling. We also provide evidence that Ey repression is a critical step in ectopic eye development and that Hipk plays an important role in this process. Because Ey repression within the retinal field is a critical step in eye development, we propose that Hipk is a key link between eye specification and patterning.",,Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We used a multi-stage design to identify and validate genes that are associated with smoking-related ccRCC.
We first conducted a microarray study to compare gene expression patterns in patient-matched ccRCC and normal kidney tissues between patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 42) a history of smoking. Analyses were first stratified on obesity status (the other primary risk factor for ccRCC) and then combined and analyzed together. To identify genes where the fold change in smokers relative to non-smokers was different in tumor tissues in comparison to patient-matched normal kidney tissues, we identified Affymetrix probesets that had a significant tissue type-by-smoking status interaction pvalue. We then performed RT-PCR validation on the top eight candidate genes in an independent sample of 28 smokers and 54 non-smokers.
We identified 15 probesets that mapped to eight genes that had candidate associations with smoking-related ccRCC: ANKS1B, ACOT6, PPWD1, EYS, LIMCH1, CHRNA6, MT1G, and ZNF600. Using RT-PCR, we validated that expression of ANKS1B is preferentially down-regulated in smoking-related ccRCC.
We provide the first evidence that ANKS1B expression is down regulated in ccRCC tumors relative to patient-matched normal kidney tissue in smokers. Thus, ANKS1B should be explored further as a novel avenue for early detection as well as prevention of ccRCC in smokers.","We provide the first evidence that ANKS1B expression is down regulated in ccRCC tumors relative to patient-matched normal kidney tissue in smokers.

Our purpose was to use the homozygosity mapping approach, aiming to prioritize the set of genes and identify the molecular genetic causes underlying AR retinal degenerations in the Israeli and Palestinian populations.
Clinical analysis included family history, ocular examination, full-field electroretinography (ERG), and funduscopy. Molecular analysis included homozygosity mapping and mutation analysis of candidate genes.
We recruited for the study families with AR nonsyndromic retinal degenerations, including mainly retinitis pigmentosa (RP), cone-rod degeneration (CRD), and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). With the aim to identify the causative genes in these families, we performed homozygosity mapping using whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays in 125 families. The analysis revealed the identification of 14 mutations, 5 of which are novel, in 16 of the families. The mutations were identified in the following eight genes: RDH12, PROM1, MFRP, TULP1, LCA5, CEP290, NR2E3, and EYS. While most patients had a retinal disease that is compatible with the causing gene, in some cases new clinical features are evident.
Homozygosity mapping is a powerful tool to identify genetic defects underlying heterogeneous AR disorders, such as RP and LCA, in consanguineous and nonconsanguineous patients. The identification of significant and large homozygous regions, which do not include any known retinal disease genes, may be a useful tool to identify novel disease-causing genes, using next generation sequencing.",,,"['homozygosity mapping', 'retinal degeneration', 'retinitis pigmentosa']",,24474277,"We recruited for the study families with AR nonsyndromic retinal degenerations, including mainly retinitis pigmentosa (RP), cone-rod degeneration (CRD), and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA).

Integrative genomic analysis of airway inflammation on genetic and protein level may help to unravel mechanisms of childhood asthma. We aimed to employ an integrative genomic approach investigating inflammation markers on DNA, mRNA, and protein level at preschool age in relationship to asthma development.
In a prospective study, 252 preschool children (202 recurrent wheezers, 50 controls) from the Asthma DEtection and Monitoring (ADEM) study were followed until the age of six. Genetic variants, mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and protein levels in exhaled breath condensate for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), interleukin (IL)4, IL8, IL10, IL13, and tumor necrosis factor α were analyzed at preschool age. At six years of age, a classification (healthy, transient wheeze, or asthma) was based on symptoms, lung function, and medication use.
The ICAM1 rs5498 A allele was positively associated with asthma development (p = 0.02) and ICAM1 gene expression (p = 0.01). ICAM1 gene expression was positively associated with exhaled levels of soluble ICAM1 (p = 0.04) which in turn was positively associated with asthma development (p = 0.01). Furthermore, rs1800872 and rs1800896 in IL10 were associated with altered IL10 mRNA expression (p < 0.01). Exhaled levels of IL4, IL10, and IL13 were positively associated with asthma development (p < 0.01).

To date, 36 genes are known to cause arRP, rendering the molecular diagnosis a challenge. The aim of this study was to use homozygosity mapping to identify the causative mutation in a series of inbred families with arRP.
arRP patients underwent standard ophthalmic examination, Goldman perimetry, fundus examination, retinal OCT, autofluorescence measurement, and full-field electroretinogram. Fifteen consanguineous families with arRP excluded for USH2A and EYS were genotyped on 250 K SNP arrays. Homozygous regions were listed, and known genes within these regions were PCR sequenced. Familial segregation and mutation analyzes were performed.
We found ten mutations, seven of which were novel mutations in eight known genes, including RP1, IMPG2, NR2E3, PDE6A, PDE6B, RLBP1, CNGB1, and C2ORF71, in ten out of 15 families. The patients carrying RP1, C2ORF71, and IMPG2 mutations presented with severe RP, while those with PDE6A, PDE6B, and CNGB1 mutations were less severely affected. The five families without mutations in known genes could be a source of identification of novel genes.

They result from mutations in many genes which has long hampered comprehensive genetic analysis. Recently, targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) has proven useful to overcome this limitation. To uncover ""hidden mutations"" such as copy number variations (CNVs) and mutations in non-coding regions, we extended the use of NGS data by quantitative readout for the exons of 55 RP and LCA genes in 126 patients, and by including non-coding 5' exons. We detected several causative CNVs which were key to the diagnosis in hitherto unsolved constellations, e.g. hemizygous point mutations in consanguineous families, and CNVs complemented apparently monoallelic recessive alleles. Mutations of non-coding exon 1 of EYS revealed its contribution to disease. In view of the high carrier frequency for retinal disease gene mutations in the general population, we considered the overall variant load in each patient to assess if a mutation was causative or reflected accidental carriership in patients with mutations in several genes or with single recessive alleles. For example, truncating mutations in RP1, a gene implicated in both recessive and dominant RP, were causative in biallelic constellations, unrelated to disease when heterozygous on a biallelic mutation background of another gene, or even non-pathogenic if close to the C-terminus. Patients with mutations in several loci were common, but without evidence for di- or oligogenic inheritance. Although the number of targeted genes was low compared to previous studies, the mutation detection rate was highest (70%) which likely results from completeness and depth of coverage, and quantitative data analysis. CNV analysis should routinely be applied in targeted NGS, and mutations in non-coding exons give reason to systematically include 5'-UTRs in disease gene or exome panels. Consideration of all variants is indispensable because even truncating mutations may be misleading.",,,[],,"24265693

The first specific objective was to determine if relationships demonstrated in previous research with adult basketball and handball participants would be replicated in a younger sample and with a more heterogeneous set of sports. The second specific objective was to examine whether sources of athlete enjoyment moderate the relationships between motivational climate and cohesion.
Athletes (N = 997; 532 girls and 465 boys; Mage = 15.26 +/- 1.20 years) completed measures pertaining to coach-initiated motivational climate, cohesion, and sources of enjoyment.
Bivariate and canonical correlations revealed positive correlations between perceptions of a task-involving motivational climate and both task and social cohesion, while ego-involving motivational climate was negatively related. Cluster analyses suggested that individuals perceiving a low task-involving climate and high ego-involving climate perceived their teams as less cohesive. Finally, the degree to which participants derived enjoyment through other-referenced competency served as a moderator in the motivational climate-task cohesion relationship. Specifically, the relationship between task cohesion and motivational climate was more pronounced for those individuals who were less likely to derive enjoyment through other-referenced competency.

Eight patients were from North America, whereas eight were Japanese, a population for which ARRP seems to have different genetic drivers. Using a specific workflow, we assessed both the coding and noncoding regions of the human genome, including the evaluation of highly polymorphic SNPs, structural and copy number variations, as well as 69 control genomes sequenced by the same procedures. We detected homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in 7 genes associated with ARRP (USH2A, RDH12, CNGB1, EYS, PDE6B, DFNB31, and CERKL) in eight patients, three Japanese and five Americans. Fourteen of the 16 mutant alleles identified were previously unknown. Among these, there was a 2.3-kb deletion in USH2A and an inverted duplication of ~446 kb in EYS, which would have likely escaped conventional screening techniques or exome sequencing. Moreover, in another Japanese patient, we identified a homozygous frameshift (p.L206fs), absent in more than 2,500 chromosomes from ethnically matched controls, in the ciliary gene NEK2, encoding a serine/threonine-protein kinase. Inactivation of this gene in zebrafish induced retinal photoreceptor defects that were rescued by human NEK2 mRNA. In addition to identifying a previously undescribed ARRP gene, our study highlights the importance of rare structural DNA variations in Mendelian diseases and advocates the need for screening approaches that transcend the analysis of the coding sequences of the human genome.",,,"['ciliopathy', 'medical genetics', 'ophthalmology', 'retinal blindness']",,"24043777

We developed a diagnostic NGS pipeline to identify mutations in 170 genetically and clinically unselected RD patients. NGS was applied to 105 RD-associated genes. Underrepresented regions were examined by Sanger sequencing. The NGS approach was successfully established using cases with known sequence alterations. Depending on the initial clinical diagnosis, we identified likely causative mutations in 55% of retinitis pigmentosa and 80% of Bardet-Biedl or Usher syndrome cases. Seventy-one novel mutations in 40 genes were newly associated with RD. The genes USH2A, EYS, ABCA4, and RHO were more frequently affected than others. Occasionally, cases carried mutations in more than one RD-associated gene. In addition, we found possible dominant de-novo mutations in cases with sporadic RD, which implies consequences for counseling of patients and families.

An early dysfunction in the immunological development of the innate immune system in combination with environmental factors possibly triggers asthma. CD14 and toll-like receptors are important components of the innate immune system. The aim of this systematic review was to obtain a better insight into the relation between CD14 and toll-like receptors and childhood asthma in Caucasians. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for relevant articles. In total, 44 articles were included. The quality of the selected studies was independently assessed by the first two authors using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Toll-like receptor 2, toll-like receptor 6, toll-like receptor 9, and toll-like receptor 10 appear to have some association with childhood asthma in Caucasians. The evidence for a relation of CD14 with childhood asthma is limited. In conclusion, there is no convincing evidence yet for a role of CD14 and toll-like receptors in relation to childhood asthma. Future studies should include haplotype analysis and take environmental factors into account to further clarify the role of CD14 and toll-like receptors on childhood asthma.",,,[],,"23496969

The study population comprised ten unrelated RP subjects with very likely pathogenic mutations in both alleles, four of them with a homozygous c.4957_4958insA mutation. The phenotype analysis was based on ophthalmic examination, Goldmann perimetry, and digital fundus photography.
The study population included six men and four women aged 34-74 years. The average age at first visit was 31 years (range, 14-44 years), and the patients typically presented with night blindness as the initial symptom and subsequently developed progressive constriction of the visual field. Myopia was noted in 9/20 affected eyes. For most patients, central visual acuity was preserved relatively well up to their thirties, after which it deteriorated rapidly over the next two decades. The visual acuity of patients homozygous for the c.4957_4958insA mutation was uniform. Visual fields were constricted symmetrically, and the extent of constriction seemed to be better correlated with age than visual acuity. The fundus displayed bone spicules, which increased in density with age, and attenuated retinal vessels.

In the healthy heart, not only insulin, but also increased contractile activity stimulates glucose uptake. Upon increased contraction both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase D (PKD) are activated, and mediate the stimulation of glucose uptake into cardiomyocytes. Therefore, each of these kinases is a potential therapeutic target in the diabetic heart because they may serve to bypass defective insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. To test the preventive potential of these kinases against loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, AMPK or PKD were adenovirally overexpressed in primary cultures of insulin resistant cardiomyocytes for assaying substrate uptake, insulin responsiveness and lipid accumulation. To induce insulin resistance and lipid loading, rat primary cardiomyocytes were cultured in the presence of high insulin (100 nM; HI) or high palmitate (palmitate/BSA: 3/1; HP). HI and HP each reduced insulin responsiveness, and increased basal palmitate uptake and lipid storage. Overexpression of each of the kinases prevented loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Overexpression of AMPK also prevented loss of insulin signaling in HI- and HP-cultured cardiomyocytes, but did not prevent lipid accumulation. In contrast, overexpression of PKD prevented lipid accumulation, but not loss of insulin signaling in HI- and HP-cultured cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, AMPK and PKD prevent loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into cardiomyocytes cultured under insulin resistance-inducing conditions through different mechanisms.

The morphogenesis of these compartments is integral for photoreceptor cell integrity and function. However, little is known about the elementary cellular and molecular mechanisms required to generate these compartments. Here we investigate whether a conserved cellular mechanism exists to create the phototransduction compartments by examining the functional role of a photoreceptor protein common to both rhabdomeric and ciliated photoreceptor cells, Prominin. First and foremost we demonstrate that the physiological role of Prominin is conserved between rhabdomeric and ciliated photoreceptor cells. Human Prominin1 is not only capable of rescuing the corresponding rhabdomeric Drosophila prominin mutation but also demonstrates a conserved genetic interaction with a second photoreceptor protein Eyes Shut. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Prominin homologs in vertebrate and invertebrate photoreceptors require the same structural features and post-translational modifications for function. Moreover, expression of mutant human Prominin1, associated with autosomal dominant retinal degeneration, in rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells disrupts morphogenesis in ways paralleling retinal degeneration seen in ciliated photoreceptors. Taken together, our results suggest the existence of an ancestral Prominin-directed cellular mechanism to create and model the apical membranes of the two fundamental types of photoreceptor cells into their respective phototransduction compartments.",,Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

During the onset of diet-induced insulin resistance, elevated lipid levels in the circulation interfere with insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, leading to impaired glucose utilization. Recently, we identified vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) 2 and 3 to be required for insulin- and contraction-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, respectively, in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated whether overexpression of VAMP2 and/or VAMP3 could protect insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation under conditions of insulin resistance. HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes transiently overexpressing either VAMP2 or VAMP3 were cultured for 16 h with elevated concentrations of palmitate and insulin. Upon subsequent acute stimulation with insulin, we measured GLUT4 translocation, plasmalemmal presence of the fatty acid transporter CD36, and myocellular lipid accumulation. Overexpression of VAMP3, but not VAMP2, completely prevented lipid-induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Furthermore, the plasmalemmal presence of CD36 and intracellular lipid levels remained normal in cells overexpressing VAMP3. However, insulin signaling was not retained, indicating an effect of VAMP3 overexpression downstream of PKB/Akt. Furthermore, we revealed that endogenous VAMP3 is bound by the contraction-activated protein kinase D (PKD), and contraction and VAMP3 overexpression protect insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation via a common mechanism. These observations indicate that PKD activates GLUT4 translocation via a VAMP3-dependent trafficking step, which pathway might be valuable to rescue constrained glucose utilization in the insulin-resistant heart.",,,[],,"22936810

Previous work has shown that, for females, team sport athletes are more desirable as mates than individual sport athletes and non-participants. In the present study, the perceptions of males and females were examined regarding potential mates based on sport participation. It was predicted that team sport athletes would be more positively perceived than individual sport athletes and non-participants by both males and females. A questionnaire, a photograph, and manipulated descriptions were used to gauge perceptual differences with respect to team sport athletes, individual sport athletes, and extra-curricular club participants for 125 females and 119 males from a Canadian university. Both team and individual sport athletes were perceived as being less lazy, more competitive, and healthier than non-participants by both males and females. Interestingly, females perceived male athletes as more promiscuous than non-athletes, which upholds predictions based on previous research indicating (a) athletes have more sexual partners than non-athletes, and (b) females find athletes more desirable as partners than non-participants. Surprisingly, only males perceived female team sport athletes as more dependable than non-participants, and both team and individual sport athletes as more ambitious. This raises questions regarding the initial hypothesis that male team athletes would be perceived positively by females because of qualities such as the ability to cooperate, likeability, and the acceptance of responsibilities necessary for group functioning. Future studies should examine similar questions with a larger sample size that encompasses multiple contexts, taking into account the role of the social profile of sport in relation to mate choice and perception.",,,[],,22833850,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011449231CC0>,,,,,,

A total of 243 players from 26 teams representing various interdependent sports completed French versions of the Role Ambiguity Scale and the Coaching Competency Scale. Multilevel analyses supported the existence of relationships between the four dimensions of role ambiguity and the two dimensions of coaching competency at both individual and team levels. When the levels were considered jointly, athletes perceiving greater ambiguity in their role in both offensive and defensive contexts were more critical of their coach's capacities to lead their team during competitions and to diagnose or formulate instructions during training sessions. The results also indicated that the dimension of scope of responsibilities was the main contributor to the relationship with coaching competency at an individual level, whereas role evaluation was the main contributor to this relationship at a group level. Findings are discussed in relation to the role episode model, the role ambiguity dimensions involved in the relationships according to the level of analysis considered, and the salience of ambiguity perceptions in the offensive context.",,,[],,22691398,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011449239720>,,,,,,

Heart and circulatory physiology,"Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) is involved in the regulation of cardiac myofilament contraction. Recent evidence showed that protein kinase D (PKD) is one of the kinases that phosphorylate cMyBP-C. However, the mechanism by which PKD-induced cMyBP-C phosphorylation affects cardiac contractile responses is not known. Using immunoprecipitation, we showed that, in contracting cardiomyocytes, PKD binds to cMyBP-C and phosphorylates it at Ser(315). The effect of PKD-mediated phosphorylation of cMyBP-C on cardiac myofilament function was investigated in permeabilized ventricular myocytes, isolated from wild-type (WT) and from cMyBP-C knockout (KO) mice, incubated in the presence of full-length active PKD. In WT myocytes, PKD increased both myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity (pCa(50)) and maximal Ca(2+)-activated tension of contraction (T(max)). In cMyBP-C KO skinned myocytes, PKD increased pCa(50) but did not alter T(max). This suggests that cMyBP-C is not involved in PKD-mediated sensitization of myofilaments to Ca(2+) but is essential for PKD-induced increase in T(max). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of both PKD-Ser(916) and cMyBP-C-Ser(315) was contraction frequency-dependent, suggesting that PKD-mediated cMyBP-C phosphorylation is operational primarily during periods of increased contractile activity. Thus, during high contraction frequency, PKD facilitates contraction of cardiomyocytes by increasing Ca(2+) sensitivity and by an increased T(max) through phosphorylation of cMyBP-C.",,,[],,"22636676

Nurseries in deprived communities in Dundee, Scotland.
111 children aged 3-5 years attending nursery, including 79 parents and 8 nursery staff.
Staff session targeted outcome expectancies, subjective norms and self-efficacy for tooth-brushing in nursery using information provision, modelling and goal-setting, followed by a three-week intervention. Parent-child dyads received a leaflet with instructions for goal-setting, planning and monitoring home brushing. Tooth-brushing self-monitoring materials (e.g. two-minute timer, diaries) were used and certificates provided in the nursery as rewards.

Recently, arRP has been associated with mutations in EYS (Eyes shut homolog), which is a major causative gene for this disease. This study was conducted to determine the spectrum and frequency of EYS mutations in 100 Japanese arRP patients. To determine the prevalence of EYS mutations, all EYS exons were screened for mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification, and sequence analysis was performed. We detected 67 sequence alterations in EYS, of which 21 were novel. Of these, 7 were very likely pathogenic mutations, 6 were possible pathogenic mutations, and 54 were predicted non-pathogenic sequence alterations. The minimum observed prevalence of distinct EYS mutations in our study was 18% (18/100, comprising 9 patients with 2 very likely pathogenic mutations and the remaining 9 with only one such mutation). Among these mutations, 2 novel truncating mutations, c.4957_4958insA (p.S1653KfsX2) and c.8868C>A (p.Y2956X), were identified in 16 patients and accounted for 57.1% (20/35 alleles) of the mutated alleles. Although these 2 truncating mutations were not detected in Japanese patients with adRP or Leber's congenital amaurosis, we detected them in Korean arRP patients. Similar to Japanese arRP results, the c.4957_4958insA mutation was more frequently detected than the c.8868C>A mutation. The 18% estimated prevalence of very likely pathogenic mutations in our study suggests a major involvement of EYS in the pathogenesis of arRP in the Japanese population. Mutation spectrum of EYS in 100 Japanese patients, including 13 distinct very likely and possible pathogenic mutations, was largely different from the previously reported spectrum in patients from non-Asian populations. Screening for c.4957_4958insA and c.8868C>A mutations in the EYS gene may therefore be very effective for the genetic testing and counseling of RP patients in Japan.",,,[],,"22363543

0,High prevalence of mutations in the EYS gene in Japanese patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.,"Masaki Iwanami, Mio Oshikawa, Tomomi Nishida, Satoshi Nakadomari, Seishi Kato",10.1167/iovs.11-9048,2012-02-04,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,"To screen for disease-causing mutations in the Eyes shut homolog (EYS) gene in Japanese patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Methods. Blood samples were obtained from 68 RP patients and 68 controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples and used for screening of mutations in the coding exons by direct sequencing. Each patient underwent a detailed clinical examination.
Nine nucleotide sequence variations causing amino acid changes were observed in homozygous or heterozygous alleles in 26 patients but not in 68 controls. Seven truncating mutations were found in 21 (32.8%) of 64 patients with nonsyndromic RP composed of 23 autosomal recessive RP (arRP) and 41 sporadic cases. The most abundant mutation was p.S1653Kfs*2, which was generated by a single adenine insertion into exon 26 (c.4957dupA) and was carried by 15 patients. The mutation p.Y2935*, produced by a single nucleotide substitution (c.8805C>A) in the last exon, was carried by five patients. These two truncating mutations were probably founder mutations because each was carried by the particular haplotype. The patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations showed a severe decline in visual acuity, whereas those with a single truncating mutation showed a mild decline.
One-third of Japanese patients with nonsyndromic arRP carried probable pathogenic mutations in the EYS gene, including two founder mutations. Because the genotype was correlated with the phenotype, genotyping in the EYS gene could be a valuable tool for predicting long-term prognoses of Japanese patients with arRP and thus could be useful for genetic counseling and future gene therapy.",,,[],,22302105,"Nine nucleotide sequence variations causing amino acid changes were observed in homozygous or heterozygous alleles in 26 patients but not in 68 controls.

So far, mutation detection was mainly performed by APEX technology and direct Sanger sequencing of known genes. However, these methods are time consuming, expensive and unable to provide a result if the patient carries a new gene mutation. In addition, multiplicity of phenotypes associated with the same gene defect may be overlooked.
To overcome these challenges, we designed an exon sequencing array to target 254 known and candidate genes using Agilent capture. Subsequently, 20 DNA samples from 17 different families, including four patients with known mutations were sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx next-generation-sequencing (NGS) platform. Different filtering approaches were applied to identify the genetic defect. The most likely disease causing variants were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Co-segregation and sequencing analysis of control samples validated the pathogenicity of the observed variants.
The phenotype of the patients included retinitis pigmentosa, congenital stationary night blindness, Best disease, early-onset cone dystrophy and Stargardt disease. In three of four control samples with known genotypes NGS detected the expected mutations. Three known and five novel mutations were identified in NR2E3, PRPF3, EYS, PRPF8, CRB1, TRPM1 and CACNA1F. One of the control samples with a known genotype belongs to a family with two clinical phenotypes (Best and CSNB), where a novel mutation was identified for CSNB. In six families the disease associated mutations were not found, indicating that novel gene defects remain to be identified.
In summary, this unbiased and time-efficient NGS approach allowed mutation detection in 75% of control cases and in 57% of test cases. Furthermore, it has the possibility of associating known gene defects with novel phenotypes and mode of inheritance.",,,[],,"22277662

0,Protein kinase D1 is essential for contraction-induced glucose uptake but is not involved in fatty acid uptake into cardiomyocytes.,"Ellen Dirkx, Robert W Schwenk, Will A Coumans, Nicole Hoebers, Yeliz Angin, Benoit Viollet, Arend Bonen, Guillaume J J M van Eys, Jan F C Glatz, Joost J F P Luiken",10.1074/jbc.M111.281881,2011-12-14,The Journal of biological chemistry,"Increased contraction enhances substrate uptake into cardiomyocytes via translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 and the long chain fatty acid (LCFA) transporter CD36 from intracellular stores to the sarcolemma. Additionally, contraction activates the signaling enzymes AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Although AMPK has been implicated in contraction-induced GLUT4 and CD36 translocation in cardiomyocytes, the precise role of PKD1 in these processes is not known. To study this, we triggered contractions in cardiomyocytes by electric field stimulation (EFS). First, the role of PKD1 in GLUT4 and CD36 translocation was defined. In PKD1 siRNA-treated cardiomyocytes as well as cardiomyocytes from PKD1 knock-out mice, EFS-induced translocation of GLUT4, but not CD36, was abolished. In AMPK siRNA-treated cardiomyocytes and cardiomyocytes from AMPKα2 knock-out mice, both GLUT4 and CD36 translocation were abrogated. Hence, unlike AMPK, PKD1 is selectively involved in glucose uptake. Second, we analyzed upstream factors in PKD1 activation. Cardiomyocyte contractions enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Using ROS scavengers, we found that PKD1 signaling and glucose uptake are more sensitive to changes in intracellular ROS than AMPK signaling or LCFA uptake. Furthermore, silencing of death-activated protein kinase (DAPK) abrogated EFS-induced GLUT4 but not CD36 translocation. Finally, possible links between PKD1 and AMPK signaling were investigated. PKD1 silencing did not affect AMPK activation. Reciprocally, AMPK silencing did not alter PKD1 activation. In conclusion, we present a novel contraction-induced ROS-DAPK-PKD1 pathway in cardiomyocytes. This pathway is activated separately from AMPK and mediates GLUT4 translocation/glucose uptake, but not CD36 translocation/LCFA uptake.",,,[],,"22158620

The current study investigated which signs or symptoms of CRPS-1 could be predictive of outcome. The incidence of side effects and complications of sympathetic blockade also were determined prospectively.
A prospective observational study was done of 49 patients with CRPS-1 in one extremity only and for less than 1-yr duration who had severe pain and persistent functional impairment with no response to standard treatment with medication and physical therapy.
Fifteen (31%) patients had good or moderate response. The response rate was not different in patient groups with cold or warm type CRPS-1 or in those with more or less than 1.5°C differential increase in skin temperature after sympathetic blockade. Allodynia and hypoesthesia were negative predictors for treatment success in CRPS-1. There were no symptoms or signs of CRPS-1 that positively predicted treatment success. A majority of patients (84%) experienced transient side effects such as headache, dysphagia, increased pain, backache, nausea, blurred vision, groin pain, hoarseness, and hematoma at the puncture site. No major complications were reported.
The presence of allodynia and hypoesthesia are negative predictors for treatment success.

Despite tremendous knowledge about the genes involved in RP, little is known about the genetic causes of RP in Indonesia. Here, we aim to identify the molecular genetic causes underlying RP in a small cohort of Indonesian patients, using genome-wide homozygosity mapping.
DNA samples from affected and healthy individuals from 14 Indonesian families segregating autosomal recessive, X-linked, or isolated RP were collected. Homozygosity mapping was conducted using Illumina 6k or Affymetrix 5.0 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Known autosomal recessive RP (arRP) genes residing in homozygous regions and X-linked RP genes were sequenced for mutations.
In ten out of the 14 families, homozygous regions were identified that contained genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis of RP. Sequence analysis of these genes revealed seven novel homozygous mutations in ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 4 (ABCA4), crumbs homolog 1 (CRB1), eyes shut homolog (Drosophila) (EYS), c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MERTK), nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group E, member 3 (NR2E3) and phosphodiesterase 6A, cGMP-specific, rod, alpha (PDE6A), all segregating in the respective families. No mutations were identified in the X-linked genes retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) and retinitis pigmentosa 2 (X-linked recessive; RP2).
Homozygosity mapping is a powerful tool to identify the genetic defects underlying RP in the Indonesian population. Compared to studies involving patients from other populations, the same genes appear to be implicated in the etiology of recessive RP in Indonesia, although all mutations that were discovered are novel and as such may be unique for this population.",,,[],,"22128245

A detailed ophthalmic and auditory examination was performed on a Portuguese patient with severe autosomal recessive rod-cone dystrophy. Known genetic defects were excluded by performing autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) genotyping microarray analysis and by Sanger sequencing of the coding exons and flanking intronic regions of eyes shut homolog-drosophila (EYS) and chromosome 2 open reading frame 71 (C2orf71). Subsequently, genome-wide homozygosity mapping was performed in DNA samples from available family members using a 700K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray. Candidate genes present in the significantly large homozygous regions were screened for mutations using Sanger sequencing.
The largest homozygous region (~11 Mb) in the affected family members was mapped to chromosome 9, which harbors deafness, autosomal recessive 31 (DFNB31; a gene previously associated with Usher syndrome). Mutation analysis of DFNB31 in the index patient identified a novel one-base-pair deletion (c.737delC), which is predicted to lead to a truncated protein (p.Pro246HisfsX13) and co-segregated with the disease in the family. Ophthalmic examination of the index patient and the affected siblings showed severe rod-cone dystrophy. Pure tone audiometry revealed a moderate hearing loss in the index patient, whereas the affected siblings were reported with more profound and early onset hearing impairment.

This switch in metabolic substrate uptake is accompanied by an increased presence of the FA transporter CD36 at the cardiac plasma membrane and over time results in the development of cardiac insulin resistance and ultimately diabetic cardiomyopathy. FA can interact with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which induce upregulation of the expression of enzymes necessary for their disposal through mitochondrial β-oxidation, but also stimulate FA uptake. This then leads to a further increase in FA concentration in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. These metabolic changes are supposed to play an important role in the development of cardiomyopathy. Although the onset of this pathology is an increased FA utilization by the heart, the subsequent lipid overload results in an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and accumulation of lipid intermediates such as diacylglycerols (DAG) and ceramide. These compounds have a profound impact on signaling pathways, in particular insulin signaling. Over time the metabolic changes will introduce structural changes that affect cardiac contractile characteristics. The present mini-review will focus on the lipid-induced changes that link metabolic perturbation, characteristic for type 2 diabetes, with cardiac remodeling and dysfunction.",,Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

All published mutations so far are based on conventional PCR and are not adequate to identify midsized DNA rearrangements. This study was conducted to establish the prevalence of copy-number variations (CNVs) in the EYS gene in a cohort of arRP patients, including individuals in whom only one pathogenic change was detected by PCR-based sequencing.
A multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used for the molecular genetic analyses of CNVs by a novel EYS-specific kit. PCR-based direct sequencing was used in families where a pathogenic deletion or duplication was identified in one allele. Bioinformatics analyses was undertaken to study the effect of the mutations on protein structure and function.
Six novel pathogenic CNVs were identified. Also, the presence of four midsized deletions was confirmed in patients previously identified. Midsized genomic rearrangements in EYS are disease causing in ∼4% of the families with no reported mutations and constitute the second pathogenic variation in ∼15% of cases where a mutation has been detected by direct sequencing.
This is the first report of a systematic CNV screening of EYS gene in a cohort of arRP patients. Results suggest that midsized genomic rearrangements in EYS gene would be a common event in the appearance of RP phenotype.

The epidemiologic evidence is less clear at the low-to-moderate concentrations typically observed in the United States. Accurate retrospective exposure assessment over a long time period is a major challenge in conducting epidemiologic studies of environmental factors and diseases with long latency, such as cancer.
We estimated arsenic concentrations in the water supplies of 2,611 participants in a population-based case-control study in northern New England.
Estimates covered the lifetimes of most study participants and were based on a combination of arsenic measurements at the homes of the participants and statistical modeling of arsenic concentrations in the water supply of both past and current homes. We assigned a residential water supply arsenic concentration for 165,138 (95%) of the total 173,361 lifetime exposure years (EYs) and a workplace water supply arsenic level for 85,195 EYs (86% of reported occupational years).
Three methods accounted for 93% of the residential estimates of arsenic concentration: direct measurement of water samples (27%; median, 0.3 µg/L; range, 0.1-11.5), statistical models of water utility measurement data (49%; median, 0.4 µg/L; range, 0.3-3.3), and statistical models of arsenic concentrations in wells using aquifers in New England (17%; median, 1.6 µg/L; range, 0.6-22.4).
We used a different validation procedure for each of the three methods, and found our estimated levels to be comparable with available measured concentrations. This methodology allowed us to calculate potential drinking water exposure over long periods.",,,[],,"21421449

More than half of all cases of retinitis pigmentosa are autosomal recessive (arRP), but the gene(s) causing arRP in most families has yet to be identified. The purpose of this study is to identify the genetic basis of severe arRP in a consanguineous Chinese family.
Linkage and haplotype analyses were used to define the chromosomal location of the pathogenic gene in the Chinese arRP family. Direct DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding region and exon-intron boundaries of EYS was used to determine the disease-causing mutation, and to demonstrate that the mutation co-segregates with the disease in the family.
A single nucleotide substitution of G to T at nucleotide 5506 of EYS was identified in the Chinese arRP family. This change caused a substitution of a glutamic acid residue at codon 1,836 by a stop codon TAA (p.E1836X), and resulted in a premature truncated EYS protein with 1,835 amino acids. Three affected siblings in the family were homozygous for the p.E1836X mutation, while the other unaffected family members carried one mutant allele and one normal EYS allele. The nonsense mutation p.E1836X was not detected in 200 unrelated normal controls.
The EYS gene is a recently identified disease-causing gene for retinitis pigmentosa, and encodes the orthologue of Drosophila spacemaker. To date, there are only eight mutations in EYS that have been identified to cause arRP. Here we report one novel homozygous nonsense mutation of EYS in a consanguineous Chinese arRP family.

Community meetings and talking circles were employed as culturally sensitive data collection techniques to uncover how to encourage youth participation in Wikwemikong's sport programs. The overarching methodology for the project is PAR.
Themes and subthemes were determined by community consensus with terms indigenous (ie, culturally relevant) among the local Aboriginal culture. Family was considered important for youth involvement in Aboriginal community sport programs. Parents were expected to support their children by managing schedules and priorities, providing transportation, financial support, encouragement, and being committed to the child's activity. Aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, grandparents, and the family as a whole were seen as sharing the responsibility to retain youth in sport through collateral support (ie, when gaps in parental support arose).

Autozygosity mapping was performed in 171 consanguineous Israeli and Palestinian families with inherited retinal degenerations. Large homozygous regions, harboring the EYS gene, were identified in 15 of the families.

Its bioactive moiety phosphinothricin competitively inhibits bacterial and plant glutamine synthetases. The biosynthesis of PTT includes the synthesis of the unusual amino acid N-acetyl-demethyl-phosphinothricin and a three step condensation via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Two characteristics within the PTT biosynthesis make it suitable to study the evolution of secondary metabolism biosynthesis. First, PTT biosynthesis represents the only known system where all peptide synthetase modules are located on separate proteins. This 'single enzyme system' might be an archetype of the multimodular and multienzymatic non-ribosomal peptide synthetases in evolutionary terms. The second interesting feature of PTT biosynthesis is the pathway-specific aconitase Pmi that is involved in the supply of N-acetyl-demethyl-phosphinothricin. Pmi is highly similar to the tricarboxylic acid aconitase AcnA. They share 64% identity at the DNA level and both belong to the Iron-Regulatory-Protein/AcnA family. Despite their high sequence similarity, AcnA and Pmi catalyze different reactions and are not able to substitute for each other. Thus, the enzyme pair AcnA/Pmi presents an example of the evolution of a secondary metabolite-specific enzyme from a primary metabolism enzyme.",,,[],,19878959,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114494114A0>,,,,,,

After birth, UBF falls in concert with the sudden decline in uterine metabolic demands. Arterial remodeling associated with the reversal of increased blood flow has been described in large arteries. It is unclear whether this situation applies to small-sized resistance arteries such as the UA. We investigated the pattern of UA remodeling postpartum in relation to age and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) deficiency.
Uterine artery of 2 and 10 days postpartum young (age 12 weeks), aged (age 40 weeks), and eNOS-deficient (eNOS( -/-), age 12 weeks) mice were dissected and processed for either morphometric analysis (lumen, wall mass) or immunohistochemistry (cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis). We used data of previously studied control (nonpregnant) and late-pregnant (17 days gestation) mice as reference.
By 2 days postpartum, morphometric and cellular characteristics of the UA did not differ from those of late-pregnant UA. By 10 days postpartum, the UA was wider with wall mass being decreased by approximately 30%. Cytological parameters indicated a stable smooth muscle media. Apoptosis was only present in UA of 2 and 10 days pregnant mice. In eNOS(- /-) and aged mice, changes were smaller or absent, respectively.
The outward hypertrophic response of the UA induced by pregnancy regresses gradually postpartum.

In one affected sib pair, a shared homozygous region of 5.0 Mb was identified on chromosome 6, within the RP25 locus. One of the genes residing in this interval was the retina-expressed gene EGFL11. Several genes resembling EGFL11 were predicted just centromeric of EGFL11. Extensive long-range RT-PCR, combined with 5'- and 3'- RACE analysis, resulted in the identification of a 10-kb transcript, starting with the annotated exons of EGFL11 and spanning 44 exons and 2 Mb of genomic DNA. The transcript is predicted to encode a 3165-aa extracellular protein containing 28 EGF-like and five laminin A G-like domains. Interestingly, the second part of the protein was found to be the human ortholog of Drosophila eyes shut (eys), also known as spacemaker, a protein essential for photoreceptor morphology. Mutation analysis in the sib pair homozygous at RP25 revealed a nonsense mutation (p.Tyr3156X) segregating with RP. The same mutation was identified homozygously in three arRP siblings of an unrelated family. A frame-shift mutation (pPro2238ProfsX16) was found in an isolated RP patient. In conclusion, we identified a gene, coined eyes shut homolog (EYS), consisting of EGFL11 and the human ortholog of Drosophila eys, which is mutated in patients with arRP. With a size of 2 Mb, it is one of the largest human genes, and it is by far the largest retinal dystrophy gene.

Their expression is strongly associated with the contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells. Analysis of mice lacking both smoothelins (Smtn-A/B(-/-) mice) previously revealed a critical role for smoothelin-A in intestinal smooth muscle contraction. Here, we report on the generation and cardiovascular phenotype of mice lacking only smoothelin-B (Smtn-B(-/-)).
Myograph studies revealed that the contractile capacity of the saphenous and femoral arteries was strongly reduced in Smtn-B(-/-) mice, regardless of the contractile agonist used to trigger contraction. Arteries from Smtn-A/B(-/-) compound mutant mice exhibited a similar contractile deficit. Smtn-B(-/-) arteries had a normal architecture and expressed normal levels of other smooth muscle cell-specific genes, including smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and smooth muscle-calponin. Decreased contractility of Smtn-B(-/-) arteries was paradoxically accompanied by increased mean arterial pressure (20 mm Hg) and concomitant cardiac hypertrophy despite normal parasympathetic and sympathetic tone in Smtn-B(-/-) mice. Magnetic resonance imaging experiments revealed that cardiac function was not changed, whereas distension of the proximal aorta during the cardiac cycle was increased in Smtn-B(-/-) mice. However, isobaric pulse wave velocity and pulse pressure measurements indicated normal aortic distensibility.
Collectively, our results identify smoothelins as key determinants of arterial smooth muscle contractility and cardiovascular performance.

Mechanotransduction relies on the transformation of minuscule mechanical forces into high-fidelity electrical responses. When mechanoreceptors are stimulated, mechanically sensitive cation channels open and produce an inward transduction current that depolarizes the cell. For this process to operate effectively, the transduction machinery has to retain integrity and remain unfailingly independent of environmental changes. This is particularly challenging for poikilothermic organisms, where changes in temperature in the environment may impact the function of mechanoreceptor neurons. Thus, we wondered how insects whose habitat might quickly vary over several tens of degrees of temperature manage to maintain highly effective mechanical senses. We screened for Drosophila mutants with defective mechanical responses at elevated ambient temperatures, and identified a gene, spam, whose role is to protect the mechanosensory organ from massive cellular deformation caused by heat-induced osmotic imbalance. Here we show that Spam protein forms an extracellular shield that guards mechanosensory neurons from environmental insult. Remarkably, heterologously expressed Spam protein also endowed other cells with superb defence against physically and chemically induced deformation. We studied the mechanical impact of Spam coating and show that spam-coated cells are up to ten times stiffer than uncoated controls. Together, these results help explain how poikilothermic organisms preserve the architecture of critical cells during environmental stress, and illustrate an elegant and simple solution to such challenge.",,,[],,"18297055

The PTT biosynthetic gene cluster contains three peptide synthetase genes: phsA, phsB, and phsC. Each of these peptide synthetases comprises only one module. In neither PhsB nor PhsC is a typical C-terminal thioesterase domain present. In contrast, a single thioesterase GXSXG motif has been identified in the N terminus of the first peptide synthetase, PhsA. In addition, two external thioesterase genes, theA and theB, are located within the PTT biosynthetic gene cluster. To analyze the thioesterase function as well as the assembly of the peptide synthetases within PTT biosynthesis, several mutants were generated and analyzed. A phsA deletion mutant (MphsA) was complemented with two different phsA constructs that were carrying mutations in the thioesterase motif. In one construct, the thioesterase motif comprising 45 amino acids of phsA were deleted. In the second construct, the conserved serine residue of the GXSXG motif was replaced by an alanine. In both cases, the complementation of MphsA did not restore PTT biosynthesis, revealing that the thioesterase motif in the N terminus of PhsA is required for PTT production. In contrast, TheA and TheB might have editing functions, as an interruption of the theA and theB genes led to reduced PTT production, whereas an overexpression of both genes in the wild type enhanced the PTT yield. The presence of an active single thioesterase motif in the N terminus of PhsA points to a novel mechanism of product release.",,,[],,"18285472

Its monitoring might allow identification of molecular changes associated with the infective stages (metacyclics and amastigotes) and contribute to the understanding of the complex host-parasite relationships. So far, very few studies have been done on Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, one of the most pathogenic species. Such studies require, first of all, reference molecular markers. In the present work, we applied differential display analysis (DD analysis) in order to identify transcripts that might be (i) candidate markers of metacyclics and intracellular amastigotes of L. (V.) braziliensis or (ii) potential controls, i.e. constitutively expressed. In total, 48 DNA fragments gave reliable sequencing data, 29 of them being potential markers of infective stages and 12 potential controls. Eight sequences could be identified with reported genes. Validation of the results of DD analysis was done for 4 genes (2 differentially expressed and 2 controls) by quantitative real-time PCR. The infective insect stage-specific protein (meta 1) was more expressed in metacyclic-enriched preparations. The oligopeptidase b showed a higher expression in amastigotes.

A salient feature of all photoreceptor cells is the presence of a specialized compartment (disc outer segments in vertebrates, and microvillar rhabdomeres in insects), whose primary role is to accommodate the millions of light receptor molecules required for efficient photon collection. In insects, compound eyes can have very different inner architectures. Fruitflies and houseflies have an open rhabdom system, in which the seven rhabdomeres of each ommatidium are separated from each other and function as independent light guides. In contrast, bees and various mosquitoes and beetle species have a closed system, in which rhabdomeres within each ommatidium are fused to each other, thus sharing the same visual axis. To understand the transition between open and closed rhabdom systems, we isolated and characterized the role of Drosophila genes involved in rhabdomere assembly. Here we show that Spacemaker, a secreted protein expressed only in the eyes of insects with open rhabdom systems, acts together with Prominin and the cell adhesion molecule Chaoptin to choreograph the partitioning of rhabdomeres into an open system. Furthermore, the complete loss of spacemaker (spam) converts an open rhabdom system to a closed one, whereas its targeted expression to photoreceptors of a closed system markedly reorganizes the architecture of the compound eyes to resemble an open system. Our results provide a molecular atlas for the construction of microvillar assemblies and illustrate the critical effect of differences in a single structural protein in morphogenesis.",,,[],,17036004,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114494FADB0>,,,,,,

Each ommatidium of the Drosophila retina forms an epithelial lumen, the interrhabdomeral space, which has a critical function in vision as it optically isolates individual photoreceptor cells. Ommatidia containing an interrhabdomeral space have evolved from ancestral insect eyes that lack this lumen, as seen, for example, in bees. In a genetic screen, we identified eyes shut (eys) as a gene that is essential for the formation of matrix-filled interrhabdomeral space. Eys is closely related to the proteoglycans agrin and perlecan and secreted by photoreceptor cells into the interrhabdomeral space. The honeybee ortholog of eys is not expressed in photoreceptors, raising the possibility that recruitment of eys expression has made an important contribution to insect eye evolution.

Before evaluating dietary effects on use of digestible AA intake for body protein deposition, a digestibility study was conducted to investigate true ileal AA digestibility and endogenous ileal AA losses in growing pigs fed graded levels of wheat shorts (WS) or casein (CS; control). A casein-based basal diet (basal) was formulated to contain 0.27 g of standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys per MJ of DE, to which extra Lys was added from WS (WS2, +0.10 g of SID Lys per MJ of DE; WS3, +0.20 g of SID Lys per MJ of DE) or casein (CS3, +0.20 g of SID Lys per MJ of DE). A fifth diet was formulated to be similar in CP level and source as CS3 but in which 6% pectin, a source of soluble non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), was included at the expense of cornstarch (CS3 + pectin). Five Yorkshire barrows (17.5 +/- 1.5 kg of BW) were fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum and randomly assigned to 1 of the 5 experimental diets in a 5 x 5 Latin Square design. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID), true ileal digestibility (TID), and endogenous ileal protein losses (EPL) were determined using the homoarginine method. Diet CS level did not influence (P > or = 0.10) TID of most essential AA or EPL (10.4 g/kg of DM intake). Including pectin in the diet did not influence TID of AA (P > or = 0.10) but increased EPL (15.6 g/kg of DM intake; P > or = 0.01). Inclusion of WS in the diet reduced TID of most essential AA (P < 0.01). The TID values for most essential AA, however, were the same (P > or = 0.10) for both dietary WS levels, except for Lys and Met, which were further reduced at the greatest dietary WS level. Increased EPL (P < 0.01) was only observed for WS3 (16 g/kg of DMI). We concluded that (1) the effects of dietary protein source on AID of AA can be attributed both to reduced TID of AA and increased EPL, (2) the impact of dietary WS level on TID of AA and EPL does not seem to be linear, (3) soluble NSP from pectin or WS exerts a greater effect on EPL than insoluble NSP, and (4) because of the metabolic cost associated with EPL and the impacts of feed composition on microbial fermentation in the gut lumen, the effects of feed ingredients on the use of ileal digestible AA for protein deposition should be investigated further.",,,[],,16699092,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000001144951E270>,,,,,,

Effects of operating conditions on the extraction, including extraction temperature (T), pressure (P), time (t), CO(2) flow rate (F) and ultrasonic power (I) were investigated. There are optimum temperatures which gives the maximum extraction yields (EYs) for the supercritical fluid extractions with and without ultrasound.

E2 treatment reduced TAC induced cardiac hypertrophy significantly in wild-type (WT) and ERalpha-/- mice but not in ERbeta-/- mice. Biochemical analysis showed that E2 blocked the increased phosphorylation of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase observed in TAC-treated ERalpha-/- mice.

Neither the site nor the concomitant rate of ADM synthesis in pregnancy is known. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the rise in plasma levels of ADM during pregnancy is paralleled by increased gene expression and protein levels in the vascular bed.
We determined in cardiovascular and reproductive tissues of non-pregnant (n=10) and 10-days pregnant (n=10) Wistar rats ADM gene expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (normalized to GAPDH). As a support for the mRNA data, protein concentrations were measured by both ELISA and Western blot analysis. Finally, ADM in these tissues was localized by immunohistochemical staining. Statistical analysis was carried out by applying Mann-Whitney U-test.
ADM mRNA levels in the abdominal aorta, renal artery and the kidney were increased during pregnancy. In addition, immunohistochemical staining in the kidney, uterus, abdominal aorta, renal, uterine and superior mesenteric artery was more intense as compared to non-pregnant rats. However, we observed lower concentrations of tissue ADM protein in pregnant rats, indicating an increased release of the hormone by the producing cells.

0,The therapy of infantile malignant brain tumors: current status?,"Chantal Kalifa, Jacques Grill",10.1007/s11060-005-6752-x,2005-10-01,Journal of neuro-oncology,"Malignant brain tumors are not uncommon in infants as their occurrence before the age of three represents 20-25% of all malignant brain tumors in childhood [1]. Genetic predisposition to infantile malignant brain tumors are known in Gorlin syndrome for example who present with desmoplastic medulloblastoma in about 5% of the affected patients. In addition, sequelae from tumor and its treatment are more severe at this age [2]. Thus, malignant brain tumors represent a true therapeutic challenge in neuro-oncology. Before the era of modern imaging and modern neurosurgery these malignant brain tumors were misdiagnosed or could not benefit of the surgical procedures as well as older children because of increased risks in this age group. Since the end of the 80s, noninvasive imaging procedures produce accurate diagnosis of brain tumors and improvement in neurosurgery, neuroanesthesia and perioperative intensive care permit safe tumor resections or at least biopsies. Consequently, the pediatric oncologists are more often confronted with very young children who need a complementary treatment. Before the development of specific approaches for this age group, these children received the same kind of treatment than the older children did, but their survival and quality of life were significantly worse. The reasons of these poor results were probably due in part to the fear of late effects induced by radiation therapy, leading to decrease the necessary doses of irradiation which increased treatment failures without avoiding treatment related complications [3]. At the end of the 80s, pilot studies were performed using postoperative chemotherapy in young medulloblastoma patients. Van Eys treated 12 selected children with medulloblastoma with MOPP regimen and without irradiation; 8 of them were reported to be long term survivors [4]. Subsequently, the pediatric oncology cooperative groups studies have designed therapeutic trials for very young children with malignant brain tumors. Different approaches have been explored: * Prolonged postoperative chemotherapy and delayed irradiation as designed in the POG (Pediatric Oncology Group). * Postoperative chemotherapy without irradiation in the SFOP (Société Française d'Oncologie Pédiatrique) and in the GPO (German Pediatric Oncology) studies. * The role of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cells transplantation was explored in different ways: High-dose chemotherapy given in all patients as proposed in the Head Start protocol. High-dose chemotherapy given in relapsing patients as salvage treatment in the French strategy. In the earliest trials, the same therapy was applied to all histological types of malignant brain tumors and whatever the initial extension of the disease. This attitude was justified by the complexity of the classification of all brain tumors that has evolved over the past few decades leading to discrepancy between the diagnosis of different pathologists for a same tumor specimen. Furthermore, it has become increasingly obvious that the biology of brain tumors in very young children is different from that seen in older children. However, in the analysis of these trials an effort was made to give the results for each histological groups, according to the WHO classification and after a central review of the tumor specimens. All these collected data have brought to an increased knowledge of infantile malignant brain tumors in terms of diagnosis, prognostic factors and response to chemotherapy. Furthermore a large effort was made to study long term side effects as endocrinopathies, cognitive deficits, cosmetic alterations and finally quality of life in long term survivors. Prospective study of sequelae can bring information on the impact of the different factors as hydrocephalus, location of the tumor, surgical complications, chemotherapy toxicity and irradiation modalities. With these informations it is now possible to design therapeutic trials devoted to each histological types, adapted to pronostic factors and more accurate treatment to decrease long term sequelae.",,,[],,"16195802

0,Uterine artery remodeling in pseudopregnancy is comparable to that in early pregnancy.,"Olivier W H van der Heijden, Yvonne P G Essers, Marc E A Spaanderman, Jo G R De Mey, Guillaume J J M van Eys, Louis L H Peeters",10.1095/biolreprod.105.044438,2005-08-27,Biology of reproduction,"During pregnancy, the lumenal diameter and wall mass of the uterine artery (UA) increase, most likely in response to the increased hemodynamic strain resulting from the chronically elevated uterine blood flow (UBF). In this remodeling process, the phenotype of vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMC) is transiently altered to enable VSMC proliferation. These phenomena are already seen during early pregnancy, when the rise in UBF is still modest. This raises the question whether the newly instituted endocrine environment of pregnancy is involved in the onset of the pregnancy-related UA remodeling. We tested the hypothesis that the conceptus is not essential for the onset of UA remodeling of pregnancy. Six control and 18 pseudopregnant (Postcopulation Days 5, 11, and 17; n = 6 per subgroup) C57Bl/6 mice were killed and UAs were dissected and processed for either morphometric analysis or immunohistochemistry. The latter consisted of staining UA cross sections for the differentiation markers smooth muscle alpha-actin and smoothelin, and for the proliferation marker MKI67. We analyzed the UA changes in response to pseudopregnancy by ANOVA. Data are presented as mean +/- SD. By Day 11 of pseudopregnancy, the UA lumen was 25% wider and the media cross-sectional area 71% larger than in control mice. These differences were accompanied by reduced smoothelin expression and increased proliferation of UA medial VSMC. All UA morphological differences had returned or were in the process of returning to baseline values by Day 17 of pseudopregnancy. The structural and cellular aspects of UA remodeling as seen at midpregnancy are also seen in pseudopregnancy. These results support the concept that the conceptus does not contribute to the initiation of UA remodeling. We suggest that ovarian hormones trigger the onset of UA remodeling.",,,[],,16120827,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114493626D0>,,,,,,

The purpose of the study was to examine whether exercising in one or a combination of four contexts for physical activity (in a structured class, with others outside of a structured class, alone but in an exercise setting, and completely alone) is related to the degree to which university students meet prescribed (i.e., CDC/ACSM) guidelines for aerobic activity.
Males (n=196) and females (n=398) completed a self-reported physical activity questionnaire pertaining to the frequency, intensity and duration of their activity in the four contexts outlined above.
A positive relationship was found between the percentage of students meeting CDC/ACSM Guidelines and the number of contexts in which physical activity was undertaken. That is, a small percentage (9.9%) were active in a single context (i.e., only one context out of a possible four), with the majority of those (5.9%) engaging in physical activity with others outside of a structured setting. A larger percentage (28.9%) were active in two contexts, while 61.2% were active in three or more contexts.

This process involves changes of the arterial smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix. Acute increases in blood flow stimulate endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO). It remains to be established whether endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is involved in pregnancy-related arterial remodeling. We tested the hypothesis that absence of eNOS results in a reduced remodeling capacity of the UA during pregnancy leading to a decline in neonatal outcome. UA of nonpregnant and pregnant wild-type (Nos3+/+) and eNOS-deficient (Nos3-/-) mice were collected and processed for standard morphometrical analyses. In addition, cross sections of UA were processed for cytological (smoothelin, smooth muscle alpha-actin) and proliferation (Ki-67) immunostaining. We compared the pregnancy-related changes longitudinally and, together with the data on pregnancy outcome, transversally by analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. During pregnancy, the increases in radius and medial cross sectional area of Nos3-/- UA was significantly less than those of Nos3+/+ UA. Smooth muscle cell dedifferentiation and proliferation were impaired in gravid Nos3-/- mice as deduced from the lack of change in the expression of smoothelin and smooth muscle alpha-actin, and the reduced Ki-67 expression. Until 17 days of gestation, litter size did not differ between both genotypes, but at birth the number of viable newborn pups and their weights were smaller in Nos3-/- than in Nos3+/+ mice. We conclude that absence of eNOS adversely affects UA remodeling in pregnancy, which may explain the impaired pregnancy outcome observed in these mice.",,,[],,15659709,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114491A2130>,,,,,,

Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to study TnI isoform expression in patients with paroxysmal or chronic AF and in goats after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of AF. In addition to cardiac TnI (cTnI), low expression of slow-twitch skeletal TnI (ssTnI) protein was found in 60% of patients in sinus rhythm or paroxysmal AF and in 8% of patients with chronic AF. In adult goat atrium, ssTnI protein expression was undetectable. Calcium-dependent degradation of cTnI protein was found in 1 or 2 of 6 animals after 1 to 4 weeks of AF. Although always low, ssTnI mRNA levels were significantly higher in patients who expressed ssTnI protein than in those who did not. Relative ssTnI mRNA expression was significantly lower in patients with paroxysmal AF and chronic AF than in those in sinus rhythm. In goats there was a tendency toward higher relative levels of ssTnI at the onset of AF followed by a normalization when AF had become sustained.
Atrial re-expression of ssTnI during paroxysmal AF in patients and during the first 2 weeks of pacing-induced AF in goats does not seem to be part of the process of AF-associated cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation but seems to result from transient cardiomyocyte stress at the onset of AF.",,,[],,15289369,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011449111AE0>,,,,,,

This process is accompanied by changes in cytoskeletal architecture of the arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Aging reduces flow-induced arterial remodeling. We studied changes in the murine UA during pregnancy and on the effects of aging on the capacity of the UA to remodel in response to pregnancy.
We determined morphologic and cytologic changes in UA from nonpregnant and pregnant mice aged 12 weeks (young) and 40 weeks (old) and correlated them with their reproductive performance.
In young mice, pregnancy induced an early increase in UA wall mass, which preceded lumen widening. These changes were not accompanied by altered densities of elastin and collagen in the ECM of the medial layer. Smooth muscle cell proliferation increased in midpregnancy and was paralleled by a transient decrease in smoothelin and smooth muscle alpha-actin expression. In old mice, these pregnancy-dependent changes in the UA wall were either absent or markedly reduced. Although by day 11 of pregnancy litter size did not differ between both age groups, the number of viable pups in old mice by day 17 of pregnancy and at birth was 25% and 60% less than in young mice.
Outward hypertrophic remodeling of the UA during pregnancy in young mice is characterized by transient phenotypic modulation and proliferation of SMCs and alterations in the composition of the ECM. In contrast, in older mice, UA remodeling is markedly reduced and accompanied with a loss of viable fetuses near term pregnancy.","Outward hypertrophic remodeling of the UA during pregnancy in young mice is characterized by transient phenotypic modulation and proliferation of SMCs and alterations in the composition of the ECM.

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that smoothelins are involved in smooth muscle cell contraction, presumably via interaction with actin. The interaction between smoothelins and three different actin isoforms (alpha- and gamma-smooth muscle and alpha-skeletal actin [alpha-SKA]) was investigated using several in vitro assays. Smoothelin-B co-immunoprecipitated with alpha-smooth muscle actin from pig aorta extracts. In rat embryonic fibroblasts, transfected smoothelins-A and -B associated with stress fibers. In vitro dot blot assays, in which immobilized actin was overlaid with radio-labeled smoothelin, showed binding of smoothelin-A to actin filaments, but not to monomeric G-actin. A truncated smoothelin, containing the calponin homology domain, associated with stress fibers when transfected and bound to actin filaments in overlay, but to a lesser extent. ELISA results showed that the binding of smoothelin to actin has no significant isoform specificity. Our results indicate an interaction between smoothelin and actin filaments. Moreover, the calponin homology domain and its surrounding sequences appear to be sufficient to accomplish this interaction, although the presence of other domains is apparently necessary to facilitate and/or strengthen the binding to actin.",,,[],,14720516,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448FD9E50>,,,,,,

Here we propose the concept and present evidence based on single-cell analysis that differentiation occurs along multiple, partially asynchronous routes. In all CD34(+) cells cultured with thrombopoietin, surface appearance of glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) preceded that of GPIb, indicating that the expression of these glycoproteins occurs in a timely ordered manner. Cellular F-actin content increased in parallel with GPIb expression. Only cells that expressed GPIb were polyploid, pointing to co-regulation of GPIb expression, actin cytoskeleton formation and polyploidization during megakaryocytopoiesis. On the other hand, most progenitor cells responded to thrombin but not to thromboxane A(2) analogue by rises in cytosolic [Ca(2+)](i). The appearance of thromboxane-induced responses during megakaryocytopoiesis was not strictly linked to glycoprotein expression, because cells showed responsiveness either before or after GPIb expression. The same non-strictly sequential pattern was observed for disappearance of the Ca(2+) response by prostacyclin mimetic; in some megakaryocytes it occurred before and in others after GPIb expression. Thus, megakaryocytic differentiation follows along independent routes that are either strictly sequential (GPIIIa and GPIb expression) or proceed at different velocities (Ca(2+) signal regulation).",,,[],,14654231,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448EF3B80>,,,,,,

We sought to examine this hypothesis by use of smoothelin, which is a marker for the quiescent smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype while not expressed by myofibroblasts.
Balloon angioplasty was performed in left iliac arteries of 25 rabbits that were killed after 3-56 days. Arterial cross-sections were immunostained for alpha-actin (general marker), smoothelin (quiescent SMC phenotype), and Ki-67 (proliferative phenotype).
Adventitial cells became transiently actin-positive (myofibroblasts) but did not express smoothelin at any time point. In media, angioplasty induced transient proliferation and coinciding transient decrease in smoothelin expression.

Antibodies to double-stranded (ds) DNA are considered to be a diagnostic marker in SLE and their presence often correlates with active disease. The murine R4A anti-dsDNA antibody was found to cross-react with a peptide, D/EWD/EYS/G (R4A peptide), identified by analysing decapeptides selected from a peptide library. The R4A peptide inhibited binding of antibody to dsDNA and antibody deposition in kidneys in vivo. In other previous work, mice immunized with the peptide in a decapeptide form bound to a polylysine backbone, multiple antigenic peptide, were found to develop both anti-DNA and anticardiolipin antibodies.
To determine if human anti-DNA antibodies bind R4A peptide, we investigated the binding of monoclonal and polyclonal anti-dsDNA and anticardiolipin antibodies to the R4A peptide from patients with SLE.
DNA binding by four immunoglobulin (Ig) G and two IgM human monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies was inhibited by the R4A peptide. While monomeric peptide was unable to inhibit affinity-purified polyclonal anti-DNA antibodies, serum anti-DNA reactivity was inhibited by an octameric form of the peptide in 10 SLE patients.

The molecular mechanisms leading to these processes are only incompletely understood. Due to their contact to the surrounding extracellular matrix, integrins have been shown to be essentially involved in cell locomotion. Therefore, the function of integrins during this process was analyzed in an in vitro model which was based on the defined quiescent and invasive phenotypes of human haSMCs induced by cell culture conditions. Flow-cytometric analysis of integrin expression between both phenotypes showed a strong upregulation of alpha 5 beta 1 (13.1x) and a modest upregulation of alpha vs beta 3 (3.4x) and alpha IIb (3.0x) in invasive haSMCs in comparison to quiescent ones. Other integrins analyzed (alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4, beta 1) did not show differential regulation. Functional inhibition of alpha 5 beta 1 reduced cell migration (-29%+/-8), invasion (-49%+/-16), collagen contraction (-125%), and attachment to fibronectin. Although, there was a clear discrepancy between alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha vs beta 3 expression levels, inhibition of alpha vs beta 3 (-45%+/-9) reduced haSMC invasion equally. Interestingly, alpha vs beta 3 unlike alpha 5 beta 1 blockade caused a significant stimulation of collagen contraction (+52% vs 154%) with possible implications on vascular remodeling. In conclusion, alpha 5 beta 1 blockade or combined alpha 5 beta 1/alpha v beta 3 blockade by specific antibodies or selective RGD peptides together with local drug delivery strategies could be a promising strategy for the therapy of restenotic lesions or atheromatous plaques.",,,[],,12505061,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448C5D7C0>,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to investigate the expression of these smoothelin isoforms in different smooth muscle tissues and to determine how they are generated.
Western blotting with a new, well-defined, smoothelin antibody was used to confirm the existence of two major smoothelin isoforms. Northern blotting, RT-PCR, primer extension and 5'RACE were applied to analyse the expression of these isoforms in human and mouse. Promoter reporter assays were carried out to establish the existence of a dual promoter system governing the expression pattern of the gene.
Antibody C6G confirmed the existence of two smoothelin proteins. Northern blotting showed that in vascular tissues a larger smoothelin transcript is generated than in visceral tissue. The cDNA of this larger smoothelin-B was cloned. Computer analysis of the open reading frame suggests an alpha-helical structure of 130 amino acids at the amino terminus of smoothelin-B.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of these phenomena are largely unknown. To get more insight into atrial remodelling at the molecular level we have analysed changes in gene expression during sustained AF in the goat.
The differential display technique (DD) was used to identify genes differentially expressed during sustained AF (13.9 +/- 5.2 weeks) as compared to sinus rhythm (SR). Dot-blot analysis was performed to confirm the altered gene expression and to establish the changes in expression after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks of AF. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to validate the DD approach and to further characterise the changed expression of the beta-myosin heavy chain gene at the protein level.
Of the approximately 125 fragments that showed changed expression levels during AF, 34 were cloned and sequenced. Twenty-one of these represented known genes involved in cardiomyocyte structure, metabolism, expression regulation, or differentiation status. The changed expression of 70% of the isolated clones could be confirmed by dot-blot analysis. In addition, time course analysis revealed different profiles of expression as well as transient re-expression of genes, e.g. the gene for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha during the first week of AF. During sustained AF the frequency of cardiomyocytes expressing beta myosin heavy chain (beta MHC) increased from 21.8 +/- 2.1 to 47.9 +/- 2.5% (S.E.M.). The overall expression of MHC (alpha+beta) appeared to be down-regulated during AF.
AF is accompanied by changes in expression of proteins involved in cellular structure, metabolism, gene expression regulation and (de-)differentiation.

Neointima formation following endothelial injury is the result of phenotype modulation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC). To characterize these time-dependent changes, a rat balloon injury model of carotid artery restenosis was assessed. We applied monoclonal antibodies recognizing desmin, sm-alpha-actin and smoothelin, a novel marker specific for the differentiated phenotype of SMC. Neointima formation could be seen from day 7 after injury onwards. During early phases, the number of smoothelin-positive cells in the media was decreased compared with uninjured controls. Smoothelin staining was absent in the neointima during formation. Increased levels of smoothelin in both media and neointima were observed at days 28 and 56, correlating with a decrease in proliferation as assessed by Ki-67 antigen staining. No such changes were observed for desmin and sm-alpha-actin. Following balloon injury, SMC in both the media and the neointima underwent an early, reversible dedifferentiation, followed by proliferation. The novel SMC-specific marker protein smoothelin can be used to monitor this SMC (de)differentiation in neointima and media. These findings support the pivotal role of SMC phenotype modulation in neointima formation and restenosis.",,,[],,11998981,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114489B6EF0>,,,,,,

Glucose (0, 443, 963 and 2398 g/d) was continuously infused in the duodenum over 14-d periods using a Latin square design. A grass silage-based diet was formulated so that treatments were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous and contained 100 and 110% of energy and protein requirements according to INRA (1989). The WBGRa was measured by the [6,6-(2)H2]glucose dilution technique, and mammary glucose balance by arteriovenous differences and blood flow measurements. Duodenal glucose infusion increased arterial glucose concentrations linearly, whereas arterial concentrations of insulin, growth hormone, and glucagon were not changed. The WBGRa increased linearly with increasing glucose loads. The increase represented 42% of the intestinal glucose supplement. Mammary blood flow dramatically increased (up to 45%) and was associated with a significant increase of arterial insulin-like growth factor-1 concentrations. Mammary gland rate of glucose disappearance ([6,6-(2)H2]glucose measurement) increased linearly, whereas net mammary balance of glucose, lactose, and milk yields increased quadratically. Net mammary balance of glucose accounted for 60% of WBGRa, except for the greatest dose (47.6%). The decrease in milk yield with 2398 g/d of glucose may be explained by an imbalance in intracellular intermediate concentrations. The milk ratio of glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate decreased significantly at the greatest infusion of glucose. In conclusion, exogenous glucose supply to a grass silage-based diet increased WBGRa, mammary utilization of glucose and milk synthesis.",,,[],,11949864,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448940AE0>,,,,,,

Matrix-degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) and changes in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype are thought to be essential for the VSMC migration that contributes to intimal thickening. We examined VSMC phenotype and MMP activity in saphenous veins obtained before and after surgical manipulation. Surgical preparation of the veins significantly increased pro-MMP-1 expression by 2-fold and significantly reduced tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP)-2 expression, whereas MMP-3 and TIMP-1 were unaffected. Furthermore, caseinolytic and gelatinolytic activities measured by in situ zymography were dramatically elevated by injury. The expression of desmin and smoothelin was significantly decreased by injury, whereas vimentin expression was significantly increased. In addition, these changes in phenotype and MMP activity were localized to a subpopulation of VSMCs, the circumferential medial VSMCs. Our data show that surgical preparative injury induces phenotypic modulation of a subpopulation of medial VSMCs to a synthetic phenotype and increases MMP activity. This may favor matrix degradation, VSMC migration, and the subsequent intimal thickening that leads to graft failure.",,,[],,11451743,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000001144889B040>,,,,,,

We screened human platelets and their precursor cells (human stem cells and megakaryocytes) for the presence of candidate influx channels, i.e., isoforms of the Trp family of proteins. Primary stem cells were cultured with thrombopoietin to allow differentiation into megakaryocytes. The undifferentiated stem cells (CD34(+)) showed mRNA expression of only a spliced variant Trp1A. Immature (CD61(+)/CD42b(low)) and mature (CD61(+)/CD42b(high)) megakaryocytes as well as platelets expressed in addition unspliced Trp1 as well as Trp4 (less abundant) and Trp6 isoforms. This unspliced isoform appeared to be specific for cells of the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage, since immature (CD14(+)/CD61(-)/CD42b(-)) and mature monocytes expressed only the Trp1A isoform. This conclusion was confirmed by the presence of Trp1A, 3, 4 and 6 transcripts in the immature megakaryocytic Dami cell line, and of Trp1, 1A, 4 and 6 transcripts in the more mature CHRF-288 cell line. The up-regulation of Trp1, 4 and 6 in the lineage from primary stem cells to mature megakaryocytes and platelets was accompanied by increased influx of extracellular Ca(2+) after pretreatment of the cells with thapsigargin or thrombin.

The expression of alpha-smooth muscle (SM) actin, SM myosin heavy chain isoforms 1 and 2, desmin, and smoothelin was investigated by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blots in tissues of the arterial wall collected at different time points and in cell populations cultured from these tissues. The expression of smoothelin, a marker of late SMC differentiation, was used to discriminate between SMCs and myofibroblasts. Both stent- and PTCA-induced neointimal tissues and their cultured cell populations expressed all 4 markers. The adventitial tissue underlying PTCA-induced lesions temporarily expressed alpha-SM actin, desmin, and SM myosin heavy chain isoforms, but not smoothelin.

0,"Benefits of nutritional intervention on nutritional status, quality of life and survival.",J Van Eys,,1999-01-07,International journal of cancer. Supplement = Journal international du cancer. Supplement,"Most cancers in children are acute diseases. Therefore, the incidence of malnutrition, in general, is not different from the incidence in the referral population. Some specific tumors, such as neuroblastoma and those resulting in the diencephalic syndrome, can be exceptions. By contrast, malnutrition is a frequent problem during modern intensive cancer treatment as the result of the associated anorexia, altered taste sensations and catabolic effects of drugs. In addition, there are psychogenic factors and metabolic consequences associated with the tumor itself. Nutritional support does improve the feeling of well-being and performance status, while maintaining or improving the immune competence, thereby potentially affecting survival by limiting infectious episodes. There is no convincing evidence to date that nutritional support has an antineoplastic effect per se, but deficiency of a specific nutrient might be beneficial because of a differential requirement between tumor and normal cells. Theoretically, nutritional support might enhance tumor growth but also susceptibility to chemotherapy. In either case, nutrition is a support modality that must be given with appropriate tumor-directed therapy if curative intent is the goal of treatment. Nutrition remains a consideration after therapy is completed. This generates different challenges. If further tumor-directed therapy is futile, the decision to continue nutritional support is difficult, but if the child is well, nutritional rehabilitation must be pursued. Finally, the cured child continues to benefit from dietary advice. Nutrition should be viewed for what it is: supplying the most basic need of children.",,,[],,9876482,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000001144848F3B0>,,,,,,

We demonstrated the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin, calponin, caldesmon, and caveolin in epithelioid cells of rabbit ear and in human toes, finger tips, and glomus tumors by means of indirect immunofluorescence techniques and immunoelectron microscopy. Epithelioid cells in rabbit ear did not express vimentin, but it was present in human toes, finger tips, and glomus tumors. Epithelioid cells in human toes, finger tips, and glomus tumors did not express desmin, but it was present in rabbit ear. Epithelioid cells did not express cytokeratins. The epithelioid cells examined showed only a weak expression of the protein smoothelin, which occurs exclusively in contractile smooth muscle cells. Immunoelectron microscopical demonstration of (alpha-smooth muscle actin revealed a striking difference in the arrangement of actin filaments in the epithelioid cells as compared to that in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. The epithelioid cells contained a loose array of actin filaments, whereas the smooth muscle cells contained tightly packed parallel actin bundles. In the present study we observed a correlation between the lack of contractile marker protein expression in epithelioid cells and the presence of only a few filaments, although the epithelioid cells are alpha-smooth muscle actin positive. The reduced number of contractile elements in the epithelioid cells of rabbit and human anastomoses suggests a lower contractility of epithelioid cells compared to that of the surrounding smooth muscle cells in anastomoses. A second interesting difference between both cell types is the high number of caveolae in epithelioid cells. Immunoelectron microscopy showed a compact distribution of caveolae at the epithelioid cell border, but a more dispersed distribution of caveolae in the cytoplasm of the blood vessel endothelium. The benign glomus tumor was characterized by an expression pattern of cytoskeletal proteins similar to that of epithelioid cells, confirming its description as a benign tumor.",,,[],,9450634,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000001144765CA90>,,,,,,
0,Dedifferentiation of atrial cardiomyocytes as a result of chronic atrial fibrillation.,"J Ausma, M Wijffels, G van Eys, M Koide, F Ramaekers, M Allessie, M Borgers",,1997-11-05,The American journal of pathology,"Chronic atrial fibrillation was induced in goats by electrical pacing. After 9 to 23 weeks of sustained atrial fibrillation, the morphology of the atrial structures was examined. The majority of the cardiomyocytes exhibited marked changes in their cellular substructures, with the replacement of sarcomeres by glycogen as the main characteristic. Using immuno-histochemical staining procedures, we assessed the expression and organization of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins in these cases and compared them with the expression and organization of these proteins in normal atria. Part of the atrial cardiomyocytes acquired a dedifferentiated phenotype, as deduced from the re-expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, the disappearance of cardiotin, and the staining patterns of titin, which resembled those of embryonic cardiomyocytes. From these results we conclude that chronic atrial fibrillation induces myocardial dedifferentiation. This model of chronic atrial fibrillation in goats offers the possibility to study the time course of changes in cardiac structure during sustained atrial fibrillation and after cardioversion.",,,[],,"9327732

A trial of mechlorethamine, vincristine (oncovin), procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) was performed to test the hypothesis that replacing radiotherapy with chemotherapy would improve survival and decrease long term morbidity of infants who have brain tumors. Between 1976 and 1988, 17 consecutive children less than 36 months old when diagnosed with medulloblastoma or ependymoma were treated with MOPP chemotherapy as primary therapy following surgical excision or biopsy of the tumor. Radiotherapy was reserved for recurrent disease. Ten of 17 children have survived without evidence of disease: medulloblastoma eight of 12 with median survival time of 10.6 years (range, 6.2 to 15.2 yrs); and ependymoma, 2 of 5 (at 13.0 and 16.0 yrs). Four of the 10 children with medulloblastoma and ependymoma who relapsed are now disease free at 7.5, 11.7, 12.2 and 13.5 yrs post relapse after receiving salvage therapy with cisplatin (n = 1) or irradiation (n = 3). All relapses occurred within 26 months of diagnosis. Data on growth demonstrated height less than the 5th percentile in all children who received cranial irradiation compared to 25 to 95th percentile for nonirradiated children. Intellectual ability for the group who did not require radiation was within normal range (mean IQ 100.1) and stable across annual assessments. Those who required radiation had lower IOs which continued to decline over time (mean IQ 85 at mean age of 5.8 years, declining to 63 at 10 years). In young children with brain tumors, primary chemotherapy with MOPP, omitting radiotherapy, provides improved neurodevelopmental outcome and survival.",,,[],,"9049886

It has been postulated that smoothelin represents a marker of highly differentiated, contractile SMCs. Here, we present data on the presence of smoothelin in the human vascular system that support this hypothesis. For this purpose, smoothelin distribution was studied (1) during vasculogenesis of the placenta, (2) in normal adult blood vessels, and (3) in atherosclerotic lesions. Smoothelin was first observed in placental tissue at approximately week 10 to 11 of gestation. In full-term placenta, it was found in the SMCs of vessels in the large stem villi and in the chorionic plate. Furthermore, it was present in the fetal arteries of smaller stem villi, but it was not found in the veins. In adult blood vessels, a small population of aortic (approximately 10%) and large muscular artery (approximately 30% to 50%) SMCs was positive for smoothelin. In general, smoothelin and desmin were coexpressed in the same SMCs, but expression of desmin appeared to be less abundant. However, the majority of SMCs in these blood vessels were smoothelin- and desmin negative but expressed vimentin, whereas alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) was present in all SMCs. The SMCs in the media of small muscular arteries were positive for smoothelin and desmin (> 95%), whereas the vimentin-positive SMC type was scarce. Smoothelin was absent in capillaries, pericytic venules, and small veins but was occasionally observed in the SMCs of large veins. Thus, the distribution of smoothelin in the SMCs of the vascular system appears to be limited to blood vessels that are capable of pulsatile contraction. In atherosclerotic femoral arteries, smoothelin-positive cells were detected in the media, the atheromatous plaque, and the intimal thickening. Smoothelin-positive cells were present primarily at the luminal portion of advanced lesions. The presence of a considerable number of such smoothelin-positive cells at that location may indicate that these plaques are no longer expanding.",,,[],,9108778,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114463379F0>,,,,,,

Dual labelling of ultrathin sections with antibodies to smoothelin together with antibodies to other smooth muscle proteins showed that smoothelin was co-distributed with filamin and desmin in the cytoskeleton domain of the smooth muscle cell. From the finding that smoothelin, unlike desmin, was readily extracted by Triton X-100 as well as under conditions that solubilized myosin, beta-actin and filamin, we conclude that smoothelin is most likely associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Western blot analysis of gizzard smooth muscle tissue revealed an immunoreactive protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 59 kDa that separated into 3-4 isolated variants, while avian vascular muscle showed a polypeptide band of 95 kDa. These results point to the presence of specific isoforms in visceral and vascular smooth muscles. The 59 kDa isoform was shown to be distinct from the 60 kDa filamin-binding protein, described by Maekawa and Sakai (FEBS Lett. 221, 68-72, 1987).

The human cDNA has been cloned from a colon cDNA library and the putative protein sequence was deduced. Smoothelin does not belong to a known protein family but shows a partial homology with members of the spectrin family. Transfection studies revealed that smoothelin has an affinity for actin and is either capable of forming filamentous structures or colocalizes with such structures. The protein is expressed in visceral as well as vascular tissues of all vertebrate classes. A study on the distribution of smoothelin in the vascular and placental system showed that smoothelin expression was largely restricted to the muscular pulsating blood vessels. Therefore, we hypothesized that smoothelin is expressed in contractile SMC only (36, 37). No expression of smoothelin was observed in established cell lines of SMC. In tissue explants smoothelin mRNA concentration decreases to undetectable levels within 12 hours after dissection as was in general the case in primary cell cultures. Here we report on continued smoothelin expression for several passages observed in a human prostate primary cell culture system. Smoothelin was demonstrated to colocalize with actin stress fibers but not with desmin filaments. This culture system offers opportunities to study the cytological localization of smoothelin, interactions with other proteins and should provide a system to test the promoter of the smoothelin gene. On immunoblots the molecular weight of smoothelin differed between visceral and vascular smooth muscle tissue with apparent molecular weights of respectively 59 kDa and 94 kDa. There is no evidence for the existence of another gene coding for the 94 kDa smoothelin. Thus, posttranslational modification, alternative splicing and dual promoter control are the alternatives for the expression of two isoforms of smoothelin.",,,[],,9113392,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448F8F8B0>,,,,,,

We tested as to whether racing also affects the elastic properties of blood. Mares and geldings were studied for thus purpose. After racing, there was: (i) an increased erythrocyte count independent of gender and race distance (0.32 to 1.7 km): (ii) an increased mean erythrocyte volume in both sexes; (iii) an increased heterogeneity of RBC size in both sexes; (iv) an increased plasma fibrinogen concentration and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in both sexes; and (v) an increased elastic yield stress (EYS). When corrected to a constant hct of 65%, the blood of mares, but not geldings, had increased EYS after racing. Gender differences in fibrinogen response (p = 0.72) did not account for this and the mechanism is not known. Since EYS is analogous to the point at which ketchup starts to flow from a bottle, its increase could be deleterious in vascular beds characterized by pulsatile flow, e.g. the coronary circulation.",,,[],,9108630,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114476FDA40>,,,,,,

It is exclusively observed in smooth muscle cells by Northern blotting and immunohistochemical analysis and therefore designated ""smoothelin."" A human smooth muscle cDNA library was screened with the monoclonal antibody R4A, and a full-size cDNA of the protein was selected. The cDNA was sequenced and appeared to contain a 1,113-bp open reading frame. Based on the cDNA sequence, the calculated molecular weight of the polypeptide was 40 kD and it was demonstrated to contain two N-glycosylation sites. Computer assisted analysis at the protein level revealed a 56-amino acid domain with homologies of approximately 40% with a sequence bordering the actin-binding domains of dystrophin, utrophin, beta-spectrin and alpha-actinin. In situ hybridization demonstrated that human smoothelin is encoded by a single copy gene which is located on chromosome 22. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting revealed synthesis of smoothelin in smooth muscle of species evolutionarily as far apart as human and teleost. Northern blotting indicated that sequence as well as size of the mRNA (approximately 1,500 bases) are conserved among vertebrates. Cell fractionation studies and differential centrifugation showed that the protein cannot be extracted with Triton X-100, which indicates that it is a part of the cytoskeleton. Transfection of the human cDNA into smooth muscle cells and COS7 cells produced a protein of 59 kD, which assembled into a filamentous network. However, in rat heart-derived myoblasts association with stress fibers was most prominent. Smoothelin was not detected in primary or long term smooth muscle cell cultures. Also, transcription of smoothelin mRNA was almost instantly halted in smooth muscle tissue explants. We conclude that smoothelin is a new cytoskeletal protein that is only found in contractile smooth muscle cells and does not belong to one of the classes of structural proteins presently known.",,,[],,"8707825

Lamin expression was investigated with immunocytochemical staining procedures in biopsies from patients with chronic hibernating myocardium. The expression of A-type (lamin A and C) were shown to be downregulated during hibernation, while lamin B2 remained present in hibernating cardiomyocytes in a way similar to embryonic muscle cells. All heart muscle cells were shown to be negative for lamin B1. The absence of A-type lamins in chronic hibernating cardiomyocytes could be taken as an additional argument for the dedifferentiation state of these cells.

Immunofluorescence studies revealed highly irregular nuclear inclusions of lamin A, suggesting protein or gene expression abnormalities. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based cDNA analysis followed by sequencing indicated the presence of an as yet unidentified alternative splicing product of the lamin A/C gene. This product differs from lamin A by the absence of the 5' part of exon 10 (90 nucleotides). Therefore we propose to designate this product lamin Adelta10. Deletion of the 30 amino acids encoded by exon 10 was predicted to result in a shift in pI of the protein from 7.4 to approximately 8.6, which was confirmed by two-dimensional immunoblotting. mRNA analysis in a variety of cell lines, normal colon tissue as well as carcinomas demonstrated the presence of lamin Adelta 10 in all samples examined, suggesting its presence in a variety of cell types.",,,[],,8621584,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114488B9EA0>,,,,,,

During embryogenesis this high molecular weight protein is initially observed in a punctate staining pattern in immunohistochemical studies, while during maturation titin organizes into a cross-striated pattern. The dynamic process of titin assembly up to its integration into the sarcomeres of cultured human skeletal muscle cells has been studied in subsequent stages of differentiation with antibodies to four well-defined titin epitopes. Since in maturated muscle cells these epitopes are clearly distinguishable on the extended titin molecule we wondered how these epitopes reorganize during myofibrillogenesis, and whether such a reorganization would reveal important clues about its supramolecular organization during development. Immunofluorescence staining of postmitotic mononuclear myoblasts indicate that the investigated epitopes of the titin molecule are displayed in a punctate pattern with neighboring, but clearly separate spots in the cytoplasm of the cells. During elongation and fusion of the cells, these titin spots associate with stress fiber-like structures to finally reach their position at either the Z-line, the A-I junction or the A-band. We propose that during this transition the large titin molecule is unfolded, with the amino terminus of the molecule migrating in the direction of the Z-line and the carboxy terminus moving towards the M-line. In maturated, fused myotubes the final cross-striated patterns of all investigated titin epitopes are observed. While this process of unfolding of the titin molecule progresses, other compounds of the Z-line and the A-band migrate to their specific positions in the nascent sarcomere. A-band components such as sarcomeric myosin and C-protein, are also observed as dot-like aggregates during initial stages of muscle cell differentiation and organize into a cross-striated pattern in the sarcomere virtually simultaneously with titin. The Z-line associated component desmin organizes into a cross-striated pattern at a later stage.",,,[],,8741211,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114488AB860>,,,,,,

Furthermore, primary cultures of rat myocard cells were used to examine these same processes during dedifferentiation. In particular, we were interested in the general mechanism that underlies the changes in the supramolecular organisation of titin during in vitro myogenesis. It became obvious that in the differentiating muscle cell cultures the redistribution of desmin, actin and myosin in a typical, differentiation state dependent fashion, always showed a certain delay when compared to titin. The sequence of changes in the assembly of cytoskeletal and sarcomeric structures observed during differentiation of the cell lines was reversed during the process of dedifferentiation in cultured rat myocard cells. These results all indicate that titin is an early marker of myogenic differentiation, both in vivo and in vitro, and the typical reorganisation of this giant molecule is independent of species or muscle cell type.",,,[],,"8740429

Sci. Vol. 299, pp. 355-379, 1977] published data on late-lesioned (after age 6) epileptic patients who had suffered left hemisphere lesions. They estimated that left hemisphere dominance occurred in 96% of dextrals and 70% of sinistrals. These figures have been regarded as valid estimates for normal dextrals and sinistrals. We administered the Bilateral Object Naming Latency Task, a verbal tachistoscopic task with very good psychometric properties, to 188 dextral and 72 sinistral normals. Results showed that 93.6% of the dextrals and 80.3% of the sinistrals were left hemisphere dominant. A consideration of results from a number of carefully conducted dichotic listening studies suggests, as do present results, that the 70% left-dominance estimate of Rasmussen and Milner for normal sinistrals may be too low by about 10%. It is suggested that 'bilateral dominance', present in 15% of the epileptic sinistrals of Rasmussen and Milner, may be much less common in normal sinistrals.",,,[],,8745120,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448896C70>,,,,,,

Expression of this protein in rat heart, skeletal muscles and in isolated cardiac cells was studied. Changes in expression during development of the heart were also examined. Expression of FAT was compared to that of the cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) to determine whether coexpression, indicative of related biological functions, could be demonstrated. FAT and H-FABP mRNAs showed a similar muscle tissue distribution and similar cellular localization in the heart. During development, heart mRNA levels for both proteins were upregulated in the same way. In conclusion, expression of FAT and H-FABP in muscle tissues and cell-types with high FA metabolism and the upregulation of mRNA levels associated with heart development, when FA utilization increases, support the suggested role of both proteins in FA metabolism.",,,[],,7864868,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000001144888BA90>,,,,,,

Here we report the selection of antibody fragments against the cytoskeletal fraction of T24 bladder cancer cells. To focus selection to a specific antigen, we eluted bound phage with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against cytokeratins. Our initial studies proved that such a selection procedure with a library, carrying the mouse antibody fragment repertoire, resulted in phage specificity for the antigen against cytokeratin 8, recognized by the mouse monoclonal antibody. To facilitate detection of reactive clones, monoclonal antibodies against phage epitopes were developed. A human synthetic library (> 10(8) clones) was used for selection by competitive elution after binding to T24 cytoskeleton. About 50% of the phage reacted in ELISA with cytoskeletons of T24 cells, while with noncytokeratin containing cells no reaction was observed. Immunofluorescence studies and Western blotting with a number of these clones showed reactivity against cytokeratin. We conclude that the competitive elution method can be used as a rapid technique to obtain immunoreactive phages, and eventually human single chain antibodies directed against defined epitopes which were formerly characterized and validated by mouse monoclonal antibodies.",,,[],,8597626,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448884400>,,,,,,

Phage of these pools were then allowed to bind to a cytoskeleton preparation of bladder carcinoma cells (T24).

Therefore, we studied the type and content of FABP in endothelial cells from rat heart, using molecular biological, immunochemical, and FA-binding assays. Studies were performed on short term cultured endothelial cells, two established endothelial cell lines and ultrathin cryosections from adult rat heart. Northern blotting analysis of endothelial cell RNA failed to detect either heart-type (H-) FABP or liver-type (L-) FABP mRNA, but the reversed transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed both H- and L-FABP mRNAs, indicating the presence of minor amounts of these mRNAs. Highly sensitive immunochemical assays (sandwich ELISAs) using specific antibodies raised against rat H- or L-FABP showed the contents of these FABP-types in endothelial cells to be 1-5 ng/mg cytosolic protein, which is more than three orders of magnitude lower than the contents of H-FABP in heart or L-FABP in liver. Immuno-electron microscopy also showed that the concentration of H-FABP in endothelial cells is at least two orders of magnitude lower than that in cardiomyocytes. Finally, cytosolic protein samples from endothelial cells revealed no significant FA-binding activity in the 15-kDa region. We conclude that rat heart endothelial cells contain only minor quantities of cytoplasmic FABP and that, therefore, FA transport over the endothelium is mediated by FABP only to a minor extent. It is postulated that aqueous diffusion of FA through the endothelial cytoplasm most likely accounts for the experimentally observed rates of cardiac FA utilization.",,,[],,7731058,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114486F84F0>,,,,,,

Also, a similar binding affinity constant and a similar number of binding sites per cell indicate that both MoAbs bind to the same antigen. Competition assays reveal that OV-TL16 is able to compete with OV-TL3 for binding to OVCAR-3 cells. Epitope mapping using a filamentous phage hexapeptide epitope library showed that both MoAbs are able to select identical phages, suggesting that their epitopes are identical or at least overlapping. However, purified polyclonal and monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against OV-TL3 failed to recognize the OV-TL16 idiotype, indicating that the structure of the antigen-binding regions of both antibodies is distinct. This was corroborated by molecular cloning and sequencing of the variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain immunoglobulin regions of both MoAbs. The VH regions of both antibodies were found to be distinct, whereas the VL regions are almost identical. Computer modelling of the idiotypes suggests that the complementarity determining regions (CDR), with the exception of VHCDR3, have (almost) identical spatial configurations. Our data indicate that, although structurally different in their VH regions, OV-TL3 and OV-TL16 are able to bind to identical epitopic regions on the antigen, because differences in primary structure do not exclude the formation of sufficient and similar spatial structures for the interaction with an epitope.",,,[],,"7523009

In the present study, 45 zymodemes were represented. Using the pDK10 probe, we were able to differentiate between the different phenetic complexes. No variations in hybridization patterns were found within these complexes. In addition, there was a good concordance between identification based on DNA hybridization with the pDK10 probe and that based on isoenzyme typing. The probe has been applied in identifying Leishmania strains that were isolated in Tunisia from humans, animals, or insects.

With the first regimen, standard (S), six injections of triple intrathecal chemotherapy (TIC), consisting of methotrexate (MTX), hydrocortisone (HC), and cytarabine (ara-C), were administered during intensification treatment and at every-8-week intervals throughout the maintenance phase for 17 additional doses. The second regimen, standard and MTX pulses (SAM), also specified six TICs during intensification, but substituted every-8-week pulses of intermediate-dose parenteral methotrexate (IDM; 1 g/m2) for the 17 maintenance TIC injections, with a low-dose intrathecal (IT) MTX boost administered with the first four maintenance IDM pulses.

Grouping of strains by similarity of hybridization patterns corresponds to the species subdivision of the family Leptospiraceae on the basis of genetic characteristics. Therefore, hybridization with the sphA gene can be used as a taxonomic tool.

All of the new isolates were obtained by excystation of Giardia cysts from the feces of patients in Dutch hospitals. These isolates were subjected to isoenzyme and DNA analysis together with isolates from Poland, Belgium, and various other parts of the world. Isoenzyme analysis revealed that nearly all of the newly established isolates exhibited unique zymodemes. Isolates obtained from individuals from Belgium and Poland, on the other hand, displayed single zymodemes. Genomic DNA libraries were constructed from isolates belonging to the latter two zymodemes; specific and common recombinant DNA clones were selected from these libraries. Differential screening revealed that the two isolates had only 80% of the clones in common. Restriction-fragment-length polymorphism analysis using three different probes together with two synthetic probes that are complementary to Giardia structural protein genes led to the separation of all isolates into two major groups; within these groups, a further division could be made by application of other techniques or probes. The results of DNA analysis and zymodeme classification were in general agreement; in the present report they are compared with the data in the literature and discussed.",,,[],,"1357655

Total DNA probes lack specificity whereas recombinant nuclear DNA probes work only if they contain repetitive sequences. Minicircle kDNAs of five Leishmania isolates, representative of five Leishmania taxa found in Kenya, were sequenced. Comparison of the sequences showed a 150-bp region with around 80% homology, whereas the rest of the minicircles had about 50% homology. Nevertheless, application of these probes in in situ hybridization assays as tested on Leishmania promastigotes in the vector gave good specificity and hybridization signal. Two types of labeling were tested: incorporation of biotin-labeled dUTP or directly horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled nucleotides. Both techniques provided good sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio on cultured promastigotes. Hybridization with HRP-labeled kDNA probes gave a superior signal-to-noise ratio if tested on sandfly preparations. This method provided a reliable and fast identification and facilitated the detection of promastigotes in sandflies.

However, preliminary characterization of two strains of Leishmania isolated from wild animals in a zoonotic focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, has suggested that they may represent hybrids of Leishmania major and Leishmania arabica. Evidence presented here strongly supports this hypothesis. Isoenzyme analysis and molecular karyotyping of cloned organisms indicated that the putative hybrids are distinct from other species of Leishmania, and possess characteristics of both L. major and L. arabica. Experiments using highly specific probes demonstrated that kinetoplast minicircle DNA from the putative hybrid contained L. major-specific, but not L. arabica-specific sequences. DNA fingerprinting data obtained using 6 genomic DNA probes were consistent in all cases with a L. major/L. arabica recombinant genotype, and implied both diploidy and allelic segregation.

The banding patterns were easy to distinguish, since the recombinant DNA probes hybridized with a limited number of fragments. They were also indicative of genomic relationships between serovars. The probes suggested the existence of four subgroups with extensive genomic homology within the serogroup Sejroe. A number of serovars outside the serogroup Sejroe showed genomic homology with these subgroups. Amplification with the polymerase chain reaction showed a correlation with the genomic homologies demonstrated by Southern analysis.

The relative frequency of each major immunophenotype (early pre-B, pre-B, T, or B) was also comparable for patients with or without DS. For this report, treatment regimens were categorized as either conventional (no consolidation therapy) or intensive. Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of DS, a higher leukocyte count, black race, or age older than 10 years was independently associated with a poorer event-free survival (EFS) for children treated with conventional chemotherapy. However, for the cohort of children who received intensive chemotherapy, DS was no longer an independent risk factor. In fact, event-free survival (EFS) was markedly improved to a level comparable with that observed in the children diagnosed as having NDS-ALL.

Problems with these studies have been that quite dissimilar auditory and visual tasks have often been used, and the reliability of the asymmetry measures has generally been unknown or, when known, relatively poor. We assessed the cross-modal correlation for two tasks, the Bilateral Object Naming Latency Task (BONLT) and the Dichotic Object Naming Latency Task (DONLT). These tasks are highly similar and have demonstrated high reliabilities. A significant, though rather small, cross-modal correlation was found (r = +.28). When cross-modal correlations were computed for FS- and FS+ subjects separately, no correlation was found for FS+ subjects (r = +.02), but the correlation for FS- subjects was highly significant (r = +.54, p less than .004). This led us to reexamine some previously collected data (P.L. Van Eys and W. F. McKeever, 1988, Brain and Cognition, 4, 413-429) which had administered two highly reliable language laterality tasks (the BONLT and the Dichotic Consonant Vowel Task), but had not assessed cross-modal correlation. A significant cross-modal correlation was found for FS- but not for FS+ subjects. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of H. Hecaen, M. De Agnostini, and A.

In dexamethasone-treated cells, levels of GH mRNA were increased in the nucleus by 6 h and in the cytoplasm by 12 h. Dexamethasone treatment caused a 5- to 24-fold rise in total GH mRNA levels by 48-72 h. The differential elevation of nuclear levels of GH mRNA relative to the amount of cytoplasmic GH mRNA persisted for 48 h. A transient accumulation of GH mRNA in the nucleus was followed by a brief rise in cytoplasmic GH mRNA levels in GH3 cells treated simultaneously with dexamethasone and cycloheximide. In GH3 cells pretreated for 2 h with cycloheximide, the rise in nuclear and cytoplasmic GH mRNA levels mediated by dexamethasone was blocked completely. Levels of glucocorticoid receptor were unaffected by cycloheximide. These data suggest that the stimulation of GH mRNA levels by glucocorticoids is initiated within the nucleus and that cycloheximide-sensitive events are essential for this stimulation to occur. To assess the importance of GH gene transcriptional activation by glucocorticoids, nuclear transcription run-on reactions and assays of GH promoter activity in an aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase (Neo) fusion gene within stably transformed GH3 cells were performed. Evidence for a weak, transient transcriptional activation of the GH gene by dexamethasone in nuclear run-on assays was obtained. Consistent with this idea, a 30-72 h exposure to dexamethasone raised levels of Neo mRNA in GH-Neo GH3 cell transformants by less than or equal to 2-fold. We conclude that glucocorticoid stimulation of GH mRNA in GH3 cells requires ongoing protein synthesis and can occur largely independently of GH gene transcriptional activation.",,,[],,2583364,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448E90400>,,,,,,

Here we present data that show that in a Southern blot analysis, recombinant DNA probes in combination with certain restriction enzymes can differentiate between taxa of Leishmania. Probes based on clones selected from a L. infantum cDNA library gave characteristic patterns on Southern blots for reference strains of the different types of Leishmania found in Europe, Africa and Asia. Within the different taxa little or no variation was observed. Although the L. infantum derived probes showed a somewhat stronger hybridization for strains of the L. donovani complex, the signal obtained with most probes was satisfactory for L. major, L. aethiopica and L. tropica.

This study was a prospective randomized comparison of two regimens that had as their primary differences: (1) an intensification period with Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) and asparaginase after induction; (2) a period of intravenous methotrexate before initiating maintenance; and (3) in the regimen that had those two additions, triple-drug chemoprophylaxis of the central nervous system (CNS) using methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytosine arabinoside as compared to cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate. All patients received vincristine and prednisone induction, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate maintenance, and vincristine and prednisone pulse intensification. There was no significant difference in the rate of bone marrow relapse. However, overall disease-free survival favored the arm with intensification and chemoprophylaxis because of a lesser incidence of extramedullary relapse. Thus, for treatment 1 versus treatment 3 the two-sided P values were for overall disease-free survival 0.16; bone marrow relapses 0.13; all CNS relapses 0.04; and all extramedullary disease relapses 0.013.

Adolescents with either T cell or non-T cell ALL entered remission significantly less often than did children (P = less than .02 and P = less than .001, respectively).

We compared the clinical characteristics of adolescents and children, and lymphoblast characteristics present at diagnosis to account for the inferior prognosis of adolescent patients. Adolescents had a higher incidence of T cell ALL (P = .0001) and thus a higher incidence of all T cell-associated characteristics.

It was demonstrated that the cloned desmin gene was expressed after gene transfer and that the newly synthesized protein assembles into intermediate filaments. Here we present data on the transfection of modified vimentin and desmin genes onto simian virus 40-transformed hamster lens cells and HeLa cells. Modifications included: (1) removal of exons encoding the desmin COOH-terminal domain; (2) exchange of exons encoding the COOH-terminal domain of vimentin and desmin; and (3) deletion of part of exon I of desmin, coding for the NH2-terminal amino acids 4-148. In transient transfection assays it was shown that the modifications in the COOH region had no detectable effects on the filament forming potential of the encoded proteins as demonstrated with desmin antibodies in the indirect immunofluorescence test. On the other hand, deletion of a considerable part of the first exon of the desmin gene results in a lack of bona fide intermediate filament formation. Immunoblotting with desmin antibodies of cell populations enriched for the transfected modified genes showed that the presence of the modified genes results in the synthesis of the corresponding proteins with the expected molecular weights. From our results we conclude that in vivo: (1) the presence of the COOH terminus is not essential for filament formation; (2) that an exchange of COOH-terminal parts of vimentin and desmin does not prevent assembly into intermediate filaments; and (3) that removal of the NH2 terminus of desmin affects intermediate filament formation.",,,[],,3332670,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114487674F0>,,,,,,

The three forages were Kentucky 31 tall fescue (TF), Kenhy fescue (KN) and a red clover-tall fescue mixture (RC). Disappearance parameters were measured by means of the dacron bag technique using cannulated steers. Exposures were for 48 h; maximum extent of disappearance for all elements occurred before this time. High proportions (greater than 60%) of P, K and Mg were released from all three forages during the first 3 h of incubation, with small losses thereafter. Amounts of N and S released during the first 3 h ranged between 40 to 75%. Ca had the lowest initial disappearance. Forages differed (P less than .05) in extent of mineral disappearance after 3- and 48-h incubations and in rate of disappearance (Kd) of the potentially available, slowly solubilizing, fraction of N, Ca and S. Across growth stages, TF had generally the lowest extent and rate of disappearance. With increasing maturity, Kd for Mg, Ca and S decreased (P less than .05). For each element, Kd was not correlated with herbage concentration or initial (3 h) disappearance. Partial correlations between disappearance of N, K, Ca, Mg and S after the 48-h incubation and herbage concentration were significant. Solubilization values corrected for rate of passage (ERS) showed significant differences among forages for K, Ca and S. Average ERS values for S and K were highest for KN; RC herbage had higher ERS values for Ca. Increases in forage maturity lowered (P less than .001) ERS for all elements. The results indicate that for all growth stages, ruminal solubility and potential availability of N and minerals from the three forages was high. The rate of release differed among elements and may have affected efficiency of microbial fermentation. Although ruminal solubility of minerals from TF was generally lower than from the other two forages, the difference was not sufficient to explain fully the lower apparent availability observed in previous studies.",,,[],,3667455,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448763F40>,,,,,,

It is stressed that the child with cancer has a nutritional state that is no different from the average population from which the child comes. What little malnutrition is seen is calorie malnutrition. The physiologic consequences are those seen in any malnourished patient. Once the patient is being treated for cancer and the cancer course has progressed, the complications of chemotherapy and radiotherapy add to the difficulty in interpretation. However, the problem of decreased resistance to infection is one of the major problems that result from this malnutrition. The one nutrient found deficient in children with cancer is iron. Because transferrin is sensitive to prolonged protein malnutrition and because of the high level of ferritin in children with certain cancers, interpretation of laboratory values defining iron deficiency is difficult and iron homeostasis may well be very deranged.",,,[],,3093050,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114474E5450>,,,,,,

The physician is not a member of the team as a researcher, but as a medical care giver. The physician also has special knowledge. The expertise that is brought to the team by a physician must ultimately be an understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.

Included was a French-American-British (FAB) classification of all new patients, which was reviewed by a central six-member committee. In addition, on the basis of immunologic criteria, patients were defined as having T-, B-, pre-B-, or ""null"" cell leukemia. Slides from 617 patients were reviewed. Five hundred forty-six (88.5%) were classified as L1, 51 (8.3%) were classified as L2, 9 (1.5%) were classified as L3, and the remainder could not be assigned. Concordance within the committee was good: in 71% of the cases the committee was unanimous, and in an additional 17% only one member disagreed. In only 11 cases (1.8%) was diagreement such that a majority classification could not be assigned. Institutions assigned L2 more frequently. There was a strong correlation with L3 for B-cell disease only. However, four patients had unequivocal B-cell disease and unmistakable L1 morphologic type, whereas one and had L3 morphologic features and had non-B-cell disease. There was no correlation between the other immunologic markers or periodic acid-Schiff stain and FAB classification, nor between L1 or L2 and risk factors. However, for the 248 null cell and pre-B-cell patients, L2 was more frequent among patients in the poor-risk group (P = 0.008). The time to first failure was significantly shorter for patients with L3 morphologic type. The induction failure rate of L2 patients was significantly greater than that of L1 patients (P = 0.016). With analysis of the duration of remission and adjustment for risk factors, the impact of L2 morphologic characteristics on outcome was not significant (P = 0.18) in null cell patients. Even unadjusted for risk factors, there was no impact of L2 morphologic type on outcome in the pre-B-cell phenotype. It can be concluded that other risk factors overshadow the impact of L1 and L2 morphologic features in predicting duration of remission.",,,[],,3484662,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448B15E50>,,,,,,

The tumors included 16 medulloblastomas and 1 each of germinoma, ependymoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, astrocytoma, and malignant teratoma. The clinical course of each patient was followed by neurologic examination, cranial computed tomography, CSF cell count, and cytology after cytocentrifugation. The correlation of CSF putrescine and spermidine levels with the clinical course of the brain tumors was analyzed. The following results were obtained: (1) A significant increase in CSF putrescine levels was observed in children with medulloblastoma when there was recurrent or metastatic disease in the sites close to the CSF pathway compared with the children whose disease status was stable after successful treatment (P less than 0.005). (2) The increase of CSF putrescine levels was the earliest predictor of recurrence or metastasis near the CSF pathway. (3) In tumors other than medulloblastoma, the levels of polyamines were not predictive of disease activity with the possible exception of germinoma. (4) Spermidine levels in the CSF were of limited clinical importance for patients with brain tumors. CSF putrescine levels may be the earliest and most sensitive quantitative marker of the progression of medulloblastoma, and their evaluation should be included in the diagnostic work-up and follow-up examination of children with medulloblastoma.",,,[],,"3958778

Results of studies of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) detailed here demonstrate that high white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis, very young or older age within childhood, and the presence of a mediastinal mass or central nervous system leukemia predict a poor prognosis within the context of certain therapies. However, not only age and WBC count, but immunophenotype of ALL as well, were especially predictive of prognosis in these POG studies.

To examine potential reasons for the poor prognosis of affected infants, clinical and biologic features of their ALL were compared. Infants had higher WBC counts (P less than .001), a higher incidence of massive splenomegaly (P less than .001), massive hepatomegaly (P less than .001), more central nervous system (CNS) disease at diagnosis (P less than .01), and lower platelet counts (P less than .001). Also, their blasts were less often PAS+ (P = .02). The incidence of non(T, B, pre-B), T and pre-B immunophenotypes of ALL did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, in patients with non(T, B, pre-B) ALL, the majority (51%) of infants had common ALL antigen (CALLA)-negative blasts, as compared with only 7% in group 1 (P less than .001). Furthermore, infants with non(T, B, pre-B) cell ALL who were less than 12 months of age were almost always CALLA- (18 of 21). The blasts of children from both groups usually expressed Ia-like antigens. These data illustrate that infants with ALL have extensive and bulky disease more often than do older children and are more often affected with a prognostically unfavorable phenotype of acute leukemia (AL) which expresses Ia-like antigens but is more often PAS- and CALLA-.

Nevertheless, the treatment results in substantial acute toxicity, and many survivors have serious sequelae. Further improvement in survival with optimal surgery and radiotherapy is not expected unless chemotherapy is added. Refinements in radiotherapy technique, however, can improve the therapeutic ratio of the treatment by lowering its side effects. In the last year children who required craniospinal irradiation at M.

Prolactin cell activity was estimated, at the end of a 3-week experimental period, by determination of the rate of prolactin synthesis during incubation of the rostral parts of the pituitary gland, in the presence of [3H]lysine. Since the secretory activity of isolated prolactin cells is known to be inversely related to the osmolarity of the incubation medium, the possibility was investigated that the effects of changes in ionic composition of the ambient water on prolactin secretion in vivo are mediated by changes in osmolarity of the blood plasma. No support was found for this hypothesis. In fish exposed to high water osmolarities prolactin cell activity was reduced, while plasma osmolarity increased. In contrast, at high Ca2+ concentrations of the water, when prolactin secretion was inhibited to a similar extent, plasma osmolarity was significantly reduced. Although direct effects of plasma osmolarity on prolactin cells cannot be excluded completely, it is unlikely that plasma osmolarity is the predominant factor in the control of prolactin cell activity in situ. The physiological significance of the capacity of isolated prolactin cells to respond to changes in osmolarity of the ambient medium--a capacity shared with some other endocrine cell types--is therefore unclear.",,,[],,3921424,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448F186D0>,,,,,,

Furthermore, location of certain tumors can result in very specific effects on the host, especially tumors in the hypothalamus, the intestinal tract, or the liver. Finally, tumors of the immune system can have significant distant consequences. However, from direct experimental evidence, from model systems, and from the utilization of nutritional manipulation in the treatment of cancer, the data suggest very strongly that there is no unique cancer malnutrition. Early diagnosed cancer does not show malnutrition as a presenting symptom. Furthermore, all metabolic disturbances can be explained on the basis of the metabolic differences of tumor cells and normal cells and are very frequently proportional to the bulk of the tumor. The cachexia that is associated with malignancies is more likely cachexia in cancer patients than it is a specific cancer cachexia, unless the tumor burden is very large. This point was clearly made in a short review of the causes of cachexia in nearly 1500 cancer patients in Russia (145). Brennan also feels that most cases of malnutrition are uncomplicated starvation, and cancer cachexia has many features seen in major injury or sepsis (16).

Univariate and multivariate Cox life table regression analyses demonstrate the independent prognostic significance of the pre-B phenotype and illustrate that the prognostic influence of potential relapse risk factors, such as WBC, sex, and age, are specific for leukemia phenotype. These findings may have importance for the design and tailoring of therapy for children with acute leukemia.",,,[],,6607082,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000001144881C5E0>,,,,,,
0,Responses of the PAS-positive pars intermedia cells in the cichlid fish Sarotherodon mossambicus to ambient calcium and background adaptation.,"G J Van Eys, S E Wendelaar Bonga",10.1007/BF00216529,1984-01-01,Cell and tissue research,"The function of the PAS-positive pars intermedia cells in fish has been connected with control of background adaptation and of plasma calcium levels. Since background reflectivity and illumination influence calcium metabolism in S. mossambicus, we have tested the hypothesis that the effects of background reflectivity on the PAS-positive cells are mediated by changes in plasma calcium. However, total plasma calcium does not correlate with the activity of the PAS-positive cells as estimated by morphometrical criteria. Transfer of S. mossambicus to a white background leads to a drop in plasma calcium, and a marked reduction of the activity of the PAS-positive cells. Adaptation to low-calcium freshwater, on a neutral background, has the same effect on plasma calcium but has no effect on the PAS-positive cells. The characteristic structural features of highly active PAS-positive cells in fish from a black background are not due to the slight hypocalcemia that occurs in these fish, since addition of calcium to the water in concentrations that fully prevent the drop in plasma calcium does not suppress the PAS-positive cells. These findings make it very unlikely that these cells produce a hypercalcemic factor in S. mossambicus.",,,[],,"6713505

Legal constraints include a patchwork of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The setting of the teaching hospital brings its own multifaceted breaches in confidentiality. Insurance and third party payment claims necessitate opening of the patient's records. But research medicine in particular broadly disseminates large amounts of detailed information about patients, creating a situation in which it is not possible to avoid revealing the patient's identity. A distinction must be made between the breach of confidentiality in connection with dissemination of the label of the diagnosis, and breach of confidentiality in relation to details of care and clinical investigation. The problem in relation to confidentiality of diagnosis is intimately entwined with the patient's self-concept. The problem in connection with details of care and clinical investigation is the consequence of the antipathy between the physician-scientist-investigator and the physician-healer-priest. These two roles are not truly compatible and, therefore, the problem of confidentiality could be greatly alleviated if the records for those two separate roles (clinical investigator and personal physician) were kept separately.",,,['Professional Patient Relationship'],,6534202,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114486556D0>,,,,,,

The skeleton is the most common site of extraneural metastases, but metastases to the bone marrow can also occur. Four cases of medulloblastoma metastatic to the marrow are reported. In addition, 31 cases from the medical literature are reviewed. Clinical features include bone tenderness, cytopenias and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase levels. Skeletal involvement, especially of the pelvic bones, is frequently seen radiographically. Weight loss, soft tissue masses and a requirement for blood transfusion are also associated features. Marrow biopsy specimens are characterized by the presence of a small cell tumor often with fibrosis, necrosis and osteoblastic activity. The symptomatic response to chemotherapy is rapid, but chemotherapy resistance appears quickly. Only 1 in 4 cases diagnosed antemortem in this review lived for more than a year. We conclude that marrow aspiration and biopsy are indicated in the evaluation of patients with medulloblastoma and may serve to diagnose the cause of cytopenias, to verify extraneural spread and to provide prognostic information.",,,[],,"6502196

This article briefly reviews some considerations relevant to the problem. The regulations create both tensions and conflicts, but in themselves are reasonable exercises of the authority under which the FDA acts. However, regulations cannot be made either so general or so detailed that they will apply to all eventualities. A major problem is the degeneration of accountability and evaluation, from a compliance with the spirit of the recommendation to a compliance with documentation. When the review of compliance of documentation is done by inexperienced individuals, adversary relationships develop and the scientific and ethical problems are not addressed. A regulation that is meeting determined and widespread opposition is not enforceable unless it is subjected to continuous official scrutiny and to continuous coercion. The regulating agency must acquaint the regulated with the regulations, but must also convince the regulated of the necessity of the regulations.

The function and products of the second cell type, the PAS positive cells, are unknown. This study reports on the identification of biosynthetic products of the PAS positive cells of the cichlid teleost Sarotherodon mossambicus. The experimental regimen took advantage of earlier morphometric analyses which showed marked differences in metabolic activity of the PAS positive cells resulting from adaptation to different background colours and illumination. Autoradiography at the light microscopic level showed that both cell types of the pars intermedia incorporate labeled amino acids during in vitro incubation. To identify the products synthesized by the PAS positive cells, labeled products of the pars intermedia tissue were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high-pressure liquid chromatography. Comparison of pulse incubations of pars intermedia tissue of fish adapted to different backgrounds and conditions of illumination revealed that an increase in the number and metabolic activity of the PAS positive cells, as deduced from morphometric data, was paralleled by an increase of the amount of label incorporated into 27K and 25K molecules. Pulse--chase experiments with pars intermedia lobes of white and black background adapted fish showed that these two products, unlike the other newly synthesized products, were not involved in any precursor-product relationship. Our data, therefore, suggest that the 27K and 25K peptides were synthesized by the PAS positive cells.",,,[],,6840522,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000001144849CCC0>,,,,,,
0,Rabbit eye exposure to broad-spectrum fluorescent light.,"D G Pitts, J P Bergmanson, L W Chu",,1983-01-01,Acta ophthalmologica. Supplementum,"Two F40CW fluorescent lamps mounted in an EYS-2404 fixture and 300 nm, 5 nm waveband UV radiation were used to expose pigmented rabbit eyes. The results of the exposures to the eye were evaluated with the biomicroscope, ophthalmoscope, light microscope and electron microscope. The following conclusions were reached: The adverse ocular responses to fluorescent radiation exposure were due to long-duration, broadband radiation. These reactions were more generalized for fluorescent exposures when the cornea and lens are compared to UV exposures. The differences between the levels of threshold exposure needed to cause damage for the fluorescent source and UV radiation were attributed to exposure duration and the rate of delivery of the radiation. Corneal and lenticular damage was mild when compared with UV 300 nm exposures, and the threshold occurred after 8 h to 12 h of exposure. The effect of the radiation was to interfere with the normal functions of the cell while changes to the inert materials in the tissues was secondary to injury to the cell. The damage was mild in the corneal epithelium, somewhat more severe in the corneal endothelium, but minimal in the corneal stroma. Early retinal changes were found after 8 h of exposure to the fluorescent source. These induced changes were evident in the neural retina as spaces and were assumed to represent oedema. The retinal oedema was initially found only in the receptor cell, outer nuclear and nerve fibre layers. Many vacuoles or spaces were located in the junctional area between the ganglion cell and nerve fibre layers while smaller spacing occurred also within the nerve fibre layer. Twelve h of exposure to the fluorescent source produced a further increase in the oedema in the retina. The outer segments of the receptor cells appear to disintegrate and significant open spaces are evident among the inner and outer segments of the receptors. The inner plexiform layer shows an increased number of spaces within and among the neural elements, and the mitochondria appeared to be undergoing changes. The 20-h and longer exposure induced severe changes affecting all layers of the retina. These changes include massive retinal oedema with degenerative signs in all retinal neurons. A sympathetic reaction of the unexposed, contralateral eye occurred as the result of the damage to the exposed eye. Minimal sympathetic responses to the cornea and the lens began at exposure durations at or above 12 h, while the retina showed the sympathetic reaction beginning at 8 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,[],,6318510,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448495180>,,,,,,

Several factors have contributed to the current dilemma: the quest for a cure by society, and the patient's hope to be cured, are often not compatible; research has become a mode of care at the expense of compromising scientific rigor; and a generation of new oncologists--who do not understand the basic precepts of science--has begun practice. Uncertainty of outcome is an unavoidable consequence of prospective randomized trials, forcing patients to rely totally on the objective tools of medicine. This destroys a major principle of medicine, namely that patient and doctor alike must have faith in the method of care, in the outcome, and in each other.

Animal experiments were performed using two different concentrations of xylitol, a 5% and a 10% solution with a total dose of 2 g/kg body weight and infusion rates of 10 mg and 20 mg xylitol per kg body weight per minute respectively. Two doses of acetylphenylhydrazine (APH), 5 and 10 mg per kg, were injected intraperitoneally as hemolytic inducers in different groups of rabbits. All the rabbits infused with xylitol showed significantly less acute APH-induced hemolysis. The isotonic 5% xylitol solution was found to maintain and restore the hematological parameters (packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, and reticulocyte counts) better than the 10% xylitol solution. Increased 51CR-red cell survival confirmed the beneficial effect of xylitol. The survival of erythrocytes as represented by chromium-labeling in rabbits infused with 5% xylitol after treatment with 10 mg/kg APH increased from about 33% (the survival of red cells in rabbits injected with APH alone) to 67% of normal rabbits' red cell survival. Erythrocytes in APH-treated animals took up xylitol more readily than erythrocytes from control animals. Our results in rabbits suggest that (1) non-toxic dosage of xylitol is effective in ameliorating the hemolytic episode induced by APH, (2) there is a dose relationship between the hemolytic effect induced by APH and the preventive effect offered by xylitol, (3) drug-challenged cells effectively acquired two to three fold more xylitol to compensate for the cellular needs than that of the normal cells, and (4) sufficient xylitol (55 mg/dl) to act as substrate for xylitol dehydrogenase was recovered intracellularly in drug-challenged rabbit erythrocyte in vivo, in spite of a low plasma (less than 30 mg/dl) concentration of the substrate. This antihemolytic affect of xylitol is likely accomplished through NADPH generation, which maintains the level of GSH and protects the hemoglobin and other structural and functional proteins against peroxidative damage.",,,[],,7289879,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448BC02C0>,,,,,,

The AS-30D and FB56 tumors demonstrated a significantly different degree of utilization of glucose and xylitol in vitro. This correlated partially with the low activity of polyol dehydrogenase when xylitol was used as a substrate. The activity ofa nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent polyol dehydrogenase in various hepatomas ranged from nondetectable to 30 nmol/min/mg protein, with the lower activities in FB56 and AS-30D tumors at 0 and 0.22 nmol/min/mg, respectively; while nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase activities ranged from 0 to FB56 to 3.31 nmol/min/mg protein in liver regenerated for 1 week. The activities of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent enzyme for normal liver and AS-30D tumors measured 2.2 and 0.14 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Although only the 311C tumor had an activity equivalent to that of normal liver, the range of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent polyol dehydrogenase activities among the cell lines studies is narrow. The ratios of metabolites of [14C]glucose or [14C]xylitol were determined in rats bearing AS-30D tumors. Animals were given i.v. injections of a 10% solution of [14C]glucose or [14C]xylitol, 2 g/kg body weight. Assays of neutral sugar metabolites from each substrate in the acid-soluble fraction of liver or AS-30D tumor showed that xylitol in the liver was converted primarily into glucose while in the tumor 80 to 90% of the xylitol remained unchanged.

This spectrum of cellular Ig expression suggests that ""null,"" pre-B, and intermediate pre-B/B ALLs represent closely related malignancies with complete or partial arrests at different stages of maturation. When pre-B, B, T, and ""null"" cell categories of ALL were compared for 22 different clinical and laboratory features, including remission rate and short-term remission duration, no statistical differences were observed between the pre-B and ""null"" groups. These early results suggest that pre-B-cell leukemias represents a relatively good prognostic subclass of ALL, do not require more intensive treatment than that proven to be effective for ""null"" cell ALL, and should be distinguished from the less common, but more clinically aggressive, B-cell subclass of ALL. Longer follow-up will be required to confirm these preliminary conclusions.",,,[],,6786391,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114490DFE00>,,,,,,

0,Evidence for a direct role of alpha-MSH in morphological background adaptation of the skin in Sarotherodon mossambicus.,"G J van Eys, P T Peters",10.1007/BF00233586,1981-01-01,Cell and tissue research,"The skin colour of the cichlid teleost Sarotherodon mossambicus adapted rapidly to changes in background colour. The physiological adaptation was associated with morphological changes in the dermis. Differences in the dermis were found between fish adapted to a black or white background for 14 days. Number and size of the melanophores as well as the amount of pigment in the cytoplasm of the melanophores were significantly increased in fish adapted to a black background. Changes in the dermis parallelled changes in the state of activity of the two endocrine cell types in the pars intermedia of the pituitary. Both the PAS positive cells and the MSH producing cells were more active when the fish were exposed to a black rather than a white background. Fish continuously infused with alpha-MSH, using an osmotic minipump, had more melanophore cytoplasm and pigment per dermis surface unit area than untreated fish. The activity of the MSH cells in MSH-infused fish exposed to a black background was reduced to a level comparable to the MSH cell activity of untreated fish on a white background. alpha-MSH treated fish that were exposed to a white background had many disintegrating MSH cells. These findings point to inactivation of these cells by exogenous alpha-MSH. The activity of the PAS positive cells was not influenced by treatment with alpha-MSH.",,,[],,"7237532

0,Structural changes in the pars intermedia of the cichlid teleost Sarotherodon mossambicus as a result of background and adaptation and illumination. III. The role of the pineal organ.,"G J van Eys, S E Bonga",10.1007/BF00216760,1981-01-01,Cell and tissue research,"The MSH producing cells in the pars intermedia of Sarotherodon mossambicus have been shown to be involved in background adaptation processes. Reflected light received by the eyes affects the activity of these cells. In the present study the hypothesis has been tested that also the pineal organ, as a second photoreceptor, is involved in regulation of the metabolic activity of the MSH cells. The pineal organ appears to contain photoreceptor cells and is considered to be capable of transferring information about light conditions to the animal. Removal of the pineal organ of fish kept on a black background has no effect on activity of MSH cells, whereas the activity of these cells in fish kept in darkness is increased. Thus it seems that the pineal organ exercises its influence on MSH cells only in darkness and that this influence results in a reduced activity of these cells. It is therefore concluded that the metabolic activity of MSH cells is inhibited not only by reflected light received by the eyes, but also by the action of the pineal organ as a result of the absence of illumination. No structural signs of secretory activity can be observed in the pineal, which might indicate synthesis or release of substances like melatonin. However, administration of melatonin reduces the activity of MSH cells. Neither pinealectomy nor treatment with melatonin has any influence on the second cell type of the pars intermedia, the PAS positive cells.",,,[],,"7197589

In humans, sorbitol and xylitol at a single oral dose of 20 g or less and fructose at 70 g or less most likely can be fully absorbed. These there sugars can maintain, either independently or nearly independently, the integrity or the carbohydrate requirement for the growth of cells and animals. The absorption of D-mannitol is no more than 80% and is more laxative. In general, there is no adverse effect other than osmotic diarrhea after oral administration of these sugars. Transient hyperuricemia was seen in some humans. The chronic toxicity of life-long usage of these sugars in humans or other primates is not known. However, a 2-year Turku sugar studies suggested the safety of fructose and xylitol. Two-year feeding experiments in mice and rats indicated possible carcinogenicity of a high-percentage xylitol diet. Abnormalities of cellular growth were also documented in animals fed high percentages of sorbitol and sucrose. Long-term mannitol feeding experiments also revealed an increased incidence of benign thymic tumors in rats. Intravenous feeding of fructose, xylitol, and sorbitol causes major concern. The toxicity is total-dose and infusion-rate dependent. The physical toxicity induced by hyperosmolar effect of the concentrated infusion solutions can be lethal. The primary metabolic toxicities, mainly lactic acidosis and hypruricemia, are reversible. The suggested safe infusion rate of these sugars is 0.25 g/kg/h; sporadic toxic observations have been reported at this or lower doses (0.125 g/kg/h). The combination of glucose, fructose, xylitol, and sorbitol mixture intravenously is in use in Europe due to the critical threshold of each element. There are positive findings from the use of the combination in human illness (114). The beneficial effect of xylitol, mannitol, sorbitol, and fructose in decreasing order has been well documented in the prevention of dental caries in animals and in humans. Oral organisms do not appear to metabolically adapt to xylitol even after 4 years of in vivo exposure. This was based on the quantitation of xylitol dehydrogenase activity in saliva and oral organisms. In addition, a therapeutic and preventive effect for xylitol in human and animal dental caries has been demonstrated. There appears to be at least a theoretical edge in the dietary use of fructose, xylitol, and sorbitol in diabetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,[],,6821187,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448CEADB0>,,,,,,

Cells exposed to physiologic and high concentrations of ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid showed poorer tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation than controls without the vitamin. The inhibitory effect was dose-dependent, with the greatest inhibition occurring as the concentration of ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid was increased. At supraoptimal concentrations of PHA and Con A, there was no recovery of the mitogen response, indicating that ascorbic acid did not inhibit the response by competition. Viability studies of cells in culture showed that concentrations of ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid, which consistently inhibited mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes, were noncytotoxic throughout the culture period. Timed addition of ascorbic acid to PHA-stimulated lymphocytes in culture demonstrated inhibition of [3H]TdR incorporation when ascorbic acid was added as late as 96 hours after initiation of culture. However, the greatest inhibitory effect was observed when ascorbic acid was added at initiation or early in culture. Inhibition was also evident when RNA and protein synthesis were determined. The results suggest that physiologic and high concentrations of ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acid affect early metabolic events in the process of mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte activation.",,,[],,7431121,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0000011448CC9DB0>,,,,,,

Effect of antigen preparation on specificity and sensitivity of the indirect fluorescent antibody test.,"G L Lattimer, B A Cepil",10.1136/jcp.33.6.585,1980-06-01,Journal of clinical pathology,"Sera from 31 Legionnaires' disease (LD) survivors of the Philadelphia outbreak, 31 Legionnaire (L) controls, and 300 additional controls were examined for the presence of specific antibodies to five antigen preparations of Legionella pneumophila (serogroup 1) to determine the effect of antigen preparation on the sensitivity and specificity of the indirect immunofluorescence test. Diagnostic levels were determined for each antigen at the upper limit of normal value (ULNV) titre, which established the titre not exceeded by 85% of controls. Antigens were prepared from formalin-killed L. pneumophila suspended in egg yolk sac (EYS) (LPF:EYS) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (LPF:BSA); and from heat-killed organisms suspended in EYS (LPH:EYS) or BSA (LPH:BSA). Antigen was also supplied by the Center for Disease Control (CDC:AG).Although there was wide variation in the sensitivity of the antigens, at the ULNV level all antigens tested could be used to differentiate LD survivors from L controls (p<0.001; X(2) test). Formalin treatment resulted in the most specific antigen by eliminating titres in L controls. The results of the X(2) test, comparing LD survivors with L controls, ranked the antigens in the following ascending order of sensitivity: LPH:BSA 15.3, <CDC:AG 22.8, <LPH:EYS 24.2, <LPF:BSA 45, <LPF:EYS 51. Moreover, when differences in positive results among LD survivors were compared, statistically significant differences were found when LPF:EYS (p<0.01; X(2) test) and LPF:BSA (p<0.025; X(2) test) were compared with CDC:AG, LPH:EYS, and LPH:BSA antigens. Titres in 300 additional controls paralleled those found in L controls. It was concluded that formalin treatment of L. pneumophila resulted in a sensitive antigen, which increased the number of positive tests in survivors while decreasing false-positive tests in controls. It should be considered for use in routine testing programmes for diagnosing LD.",,,[],,"6995497

The changes in cellular and nuclear volume, as well as the results of stereological measurements on the cytoplasmic organelles, show that the activity of MSH cells is high on a black background and low on a white background or in total darkness. In blinded fish under a normal day-night regime the activity of the MSH cell is as high as that in black adapted fish, whereas the activity is low when the blinded fish are kept in total darkness. From the observed differences in activity of the MSH cells between the experimental groups, it is concluded that the MSH cells are not activated by the absence of reflected light, but by a high ratio between direct and reflected light.

In only 33% was an adequate platelet rise seen, and in only 40% of those bleeding was the bleeding controlled. The primary factor precluding the success was the number of previously administered platelet transfusions. Infection, the use of random or single donors, and ABO matching had no effect on the outcome, but this was not accentuated in the bleeding patients.

Biochemical determinations showed that transient thiamin or pyridoxine deficient states had been induced in the antivitamin treated rabbits. In the first 24 hour following infusion with either carbohydrate, urinary oxalate levels remained within the normal range for all groups. Oxythiamin hastened the appearance of the transient, elevation in plasma oxalate concentrations seen in rabbits after infusion with glucose. After xylitol infusion, the elevation of plasma oxalate was not significnatly above normal. 4-Deoxypyridoxine enhanced peak plasma oxalate levels above those of controls for both sugars. Glucose, at an equivalent dose to xylitol, resulted in higher plasma oxalate levels than xylitol for all groups. Infusions of [U-14C]xylitol and [U-14C]glucose solutions into 4-deoxypyridoxine treated rabbits demonstrated a conversion of the administered radioactive carbon into 14C oxalate of 0.01% with a high dilution of the specific activity. The results suggest that oxalate production from xylitol is negligible; any toxicity related to xylitol administration is not a consequence of oxalate production.",,,[],,870650,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114484EC9F0>,,,,,,

0,Microtubules and associated microfilaments in the tentacles of the suctorian Heliophrya erhardi Matthes.,"M Hauser, H Van Eys",10.1242/jcs.20.3.589,1976-05-01,Journal of cell science,"At the ultrastructural level length changes accompanying linear movements of resting (non-feeding) tentacles of the suctorian Heliophrya involve not only altered microtubule numbers, but also marked changes in the specific microtubule pattern of cross-sectioned tentacles. These changes in number and pattern indicate a sliding between axonemal microtubules. The visualization of microfilaments in the cytoplasm at the tentacle base and in the knob region could shed new light on the problem of whether microtubular sliding is an active or passive process. At the tentacle base, microfilaments are either arranged in a ring-shaped configuration around the axoneme, or they run parallel to the axonemal microtubules, whereas at the tentacle tip during the resting state, microfilaments are closely associated with the plasma membrane of the knob. They form a filamentous reticular layer, which is continuous at the anchorage site of axonemal microtubules with the dense epiplasmic layer of the tentacle shaft. Obiously, this filamentous layer is engaged in positioning the haptocysts at the plasma membrane and in holding the membrane itself under tension. The putative contractile nature of microfilaments and the epiplasmic layer is argued from ATP-sensitive glycerol models of tentacles and from the results of halothane treatment of native tentacles. Halothane treatment of resting tentacles also gave indications of the presence of differentially stable intermicrotubule-bridges. The role of micro-filaments and halothane-resistant dynein-like inter-row bridges in tentacle movement is discussed. As soon as the plasma membrane of the knob is 'sealed' with the prey pellicle during feeding, the microtubules of the sleeve region slide into the knob where they bend back and outwards. The microtubules now appear decorated and sometimes cross-connected by microfilaments which adhere closely to the plasma membrane- now acting as a peritrophic membrane-lining the prey cytoplasm against the microtubules of the inner tube. These microfilaments which show a close association with the microtubules of the active knob area, are thought to be engaged in microtubular bending and stretching during feeding. They may also be involved in the transport of the peritrophic membrane in distal tentacle regions. Microinematographically recorded oscillations in tentacle diameter in these regions are in agreement with the electron-microscopic findings of various states of collapsed tentacle axonemes. These observations, as well as the occurrence of helically twisted tentacles during feeding, suggest microfilament mediated sequential back and forth movements of sleeve microtubules in the knob region which generate a proximally migrating helical wave.",,,[],,818096,,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00000114484D8180>,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that acquisition of the passive avoidance response was attended with a rise in the hippocampal concentration of serotonin 24 hr later and that this rise was not observed when acquisition was followed by amnesic treatment. In the present study, it was found that a rise in hippocampal serotonin parallelled the transient retention of the avoidance response 2 hr after amnesic treatment.

The enhanced arterial plasma glucose levels and increased mean renal glucose production significantly. The enhanced glucose release after isoprenaline could be abolished by propranolol (1 mg/kg s.c.).

Intracellular GSH (glutathione, reduced) was first converted to its oxidized form by incubation of the erythrocytes with acetylphenylhydrazine or by pretreatment with methyl phenyldiazenecarboxylate. The addition of 0.15 M xylitol was shown to be more effective than 0.15 M glucose in maintaining the levels of GSH in G6PD-deficient red cells during such oxidative challenge. Rabbit erythrocytes contain less activity of G6PD and glutathione reductase compared with the normal human adult values, but have an active xylitol dehydrogenase. The rabbit erythrocyte is sensitive to acetylphenylhydrazine and primaquine phosphate. In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, xylitol was found to partially prevent acetylphenylhydrazine induced acute hemolysis of the rabbit red cell and GSH content was found to be preserved. The intravenous injection of xylitol (0.5 g/kg body weight per 6 hr) for 6 days, seemed to be nontoxic to the animal. The results suggest that xylitol should be further investigated as an agent for the treatment of G6PD-deficient patients during acute hemolytic episodes.",,,[],,"4397414
